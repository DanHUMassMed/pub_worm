35503435,WBPaper00064006,Autophagy,2022,SAMS-1 coordinates HLH-30/TFEB and PHA-4/FOXA activities through histone methylation to mediate dietary restriction-induced autophagy and longevity.,Lim CY|Lin HT|Kumsta C|Lu TC|Wang FY|Kang YH|Hansen M|Ching TT|Hsu AL,"Dietary restriction (DR) is known to promote autophagy to exert its longevity effect. While SAMS-1 (S-adenosyl methionine synthetase-1) has been shown to be a key mediator of the DR response, little is known about the roles of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) and SAM-dependent methyltransferase in autophagy and DR-induced longevity. In this study, we show that DR and SAMS-1 repress the activity of SET-2, a histone H3K4 methyltransferase, by limiting the availability of SAM. Consequently, the reduced H3K4me3 levels promote the expression and activity of two transcription factors, HLH-30/TFEB and PHA-4/FOXA, which both regulate the transcription of autophagy-related genes. We then find that HLH-30/TFEB and PHA-4/FOXA act collaboratively on their common target genes to mediate the transcriptional response of autophagy-related genes and consequently the lifespan of the animals. Our study thus shows that the SAMS-1-SET-2 axis serves as a nutrient-sensing module to epigenetically coordinate the activation of HLH-30/TFEB and PHA-4/FOXA transcription factors to control macroautophagy/autophagy and longevity in response to DR."
32875367,WBPaper00060204,Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,2020,In vitro and in vivo lipidomics as a tool for probiotics evaluation.,Schifano E|Cicalini I|Pieragostino D|Heipieper HJ|Del Boccio P|Uccelletti D,"The probiotic bacteria are helpful for nutritional and therapeutic purposes, and they are commercially available in various forms, such as capsules or powders. Increasing pieces of evidence indicate that different growth conditions and variability in manufacturing processes can determine the properties of probiotic products. In recent years, the lipidomic approach has become a useful tool to evaluate the impact that probiotics induce in host physiology. In this work, two probiotic formulations with identical species composition, produced in two different sites, the USA and Italy, were utilized to feed Caenorhabditis elegans, strains and alterations in lipid composition in the host and bacteria were investigated. Indeed, the multicellular organism C. elegans is considered a simple model to study the in vivo effects of probiotics. Nematodes fat metabolism was assessed by gene expression analysis and by mass spectrometry-based lipidomics. Lipid droplet analysis revealed a high accumulation of lipid droplets in worms fed US-made products, correlating with an increased expression of genes involved in the fatty acid synthesis. We also evaluated the lifespan of worms defective in genes involved in the insulin/IGF-1-mediated pathway and monitored the nuclear translocation of DAF-16. These data demonstrated the involvement of the signaling in C. elegans responses to the two diets. Lipidomics analysis of the two formulations was also conducted, and the results indicated differences in phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) contents that, in turn, could influence nematode host physiology. Results demonstrated that different manufacturing processes could influence probiotics and host properties in terms of lipid composition. KEY POINTS:  Probiotic formulations impact on Caenorhabditis elegans lipid metabolism;  Lipidomic analysis highlighted phospholipid abundance in the two products;  Phosphocholines and phosphatidylglycerols were analyzed in worms fed the two probiotic formulations."
NA,WBPaper00037015,"C. elegans: Development and Gene Expression, EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany",2010,Transcriptional networks link lipid and methyl donor biosynthetic pathways,"Walker, Amy|Jiang, Karen|Rottiers, Veerle|Norton, David|Watts, Jennifer|Hart, Anne|Naar, Anders","The highly conserved sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) family of transcription factors regulates cholesterol, fatty acid and phospholipid biosynthesis genes and impact human metabolic disorders. We have examined mechanisms of gene regulation by the SREBP ortholog SBP-1 in C. elegans and identified enzymes in the 1-carbon cycle, a key biochemical circuit for producing methyl groups, as a novel metabolic pathway controlled by SREBP. The SBP-1-regulated gene sams-1 encodes the central enzyme in this metabolic circuit and synthesizes the methyl donor SAMe   which is required for most cellular methylation reactions. Interestingly, RNA interference of sams-1 disrupts normal lipid homeostasis, resulting in elevated expression of SBP-1 target genes and fat droplet accumulation throughout the worms. These findings suggest that SBP-1 may respond to changes in some methylation-dependent process when sams-1 activity is decreased. We have also found that levels of the essential membrane phospholipid phosphatidylcholine (PC) are low in sams-1(RNAi) animals, correlating with the importance of methylation for the primary PC biosynthetic pathway.  To determine if low PC levels contributed to sams-1 phenotypes, we bypassed methylation-dependent PC synthesis by dietary addition of choline. Choline rescued multiple sams-1 phenotypes, including lipid accumulation and upregulation of SBP-1 target genes. This suggests that, akin to cholesterol inhibition of mammalian SREBPs, SBP-1 may be negatively regulated by PC. Thus, we have discovered a nove  l set of SBP-1/SREBP target genes which impact production of methyl donors within the cell. Regulation of the 1-CC by SBP-1/SREBP may allow coordinated production of lipoprotein particles, and opens the possibility that SBP-1/SREBP may affect other methylation-dependent processes as well, such as epigenetic gene regulation."
NA,WBPaper00057442,International Worm Meeting,2019,Understanding the role of S-adenosyl methionine synthases under stress.,"Godbole, A.A.|Amy, Walker","Abstract  Post-translational modification of histones integrates environmental and metabolic cues with chromatin to elicit a pattern of gene expression and influence downstream and cellular processes. One such PTM is methylation carried out by histone methyltransferases which utilize methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), which is produced by the 1-carbon cycle.  Changes in the environment can perturb SAM content, which in turn influences interplay between histone modification, gene expression and adaptation to the environment. The C. elegans genome encodes four SAM synthases - sams-1,3,4 and 5, with sams-1 contributing to ~ 50% of the SAM pool in the adult worm. Although the individual SAM synthases share a high degree of sequence homology and carry out identical biochemical function, using RNASeq, we found they are responsible for expression of distinct gene sets, suggesting distinct biological effects. SAM is important for maintenance of H3K4me3 in adult intestinal cells and we previously found that one SAM synthase, sams-1, and H3K4me3 were important for gene expression and survival in bacterial and xenotoxic stress.  However, sams-1(RNAi) animals survived better during heat shock.  In order to understand this paradox, we examined H3K4me3 during the heat shock response and found that H3K4me3 levels were restored, despite the loss of sams-1. This suggests other regulators of H3K4me3 may contribute in this instance.  Therefore, we asked if other potential modifiers of H3K4 including methyltransferases, demethylases or other SAM synthases might contribute to the increased H3K4me3 in the absence of sams-1.  Using RNAi to knockdown these modifiers in sams-1(lof) animals under heat stress, we found that one histone demethylase, spr-5, was required for the H3K4me3 rescue and for the enhanced survival of the sams-1(lof) animals.  This possibly indicates a role for the demethylases in driving the perturbation in gene expression essential for survival under heat stress.  Finally, we found that knockdown of either sams-3 or sams-4 reduced the survival in heat shock, indicating that individual SAM synthases have distinct physiological roles in this stress response. Our results suggests that SAM produced by distinct synthases may have independent roles in basal or gene expression in response to stress."
21647448,WBPaper00038491,PLoS One,2011,OrthoList: a compendium of C. elegans genes with human orthologs.,Shaye DD|Greenwald I,"BACKGROUND: C. elegans is an important model for genetic studies relevant to human biology and disease. We sought to assess the orthology between C. elegans and human genes to understand better the relationship between their genomes and to generate a compelling list of candidates to streamline RNAi-based screens in this model. RESULTS: We performed a meta-analysis of results from four orthology prediction programs and generated a compendium, ""OrthoList"", containing 7,663 C. elegans protein-coding genes. Various assessments indicate that OrthoList has extensive coverage with low false-positive and false-negative rates. Part of this evaluation examined the conservation of components of the receptor tyrosine kinase, Notch, Wnt, TGF-B and insulin signaling pathways, and led us to update compendia of conserved C. elegans kinases, nuclear hormone receptors, F-box proteins, and transcription factors. Comparison with two published genome-wide RNAi screens indicated that virtually all of the conserved hits would have been obtained had just the OrthoList set (38% of the genome) been targeted. We compiled Ortholist by InterPro domains and Gene Ontology annotation, making it easy to identify C. elegans orthologs of human disease genes for potential functional analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We anticipate that OrthoList will be of considerable utility to C. elegans researchers for streamlining RNAi screens, by focusing on genes with apparent human orthologs, thus reducing screening effort by 60%. Moreover, we find that OrthoList provides a useful basis for annotating orthology and reveals more C. elegans orthologs of human genes in various functional groups, such as transcription factors, than previously described."

In <i>Caenorhabditis elegans,</i> low vitamin B12, or genetic perturbation of the canonical propionate breakdown pathway results in propionate accumulation and the transcriptional activation of a propionate shunt pathway. This propionate-dependent mechanism requires <i>nhr-10</i> and is referred to as 'B12-mechanism-I'. Here, we report that vitamin B12 represses the expression of Met/SAM cycle genes by a propionate-independent mechanism we refer to as 'B12-mechanism-II'. This mechanism is activated by perturbations in the Met/SAM cycle, genetically or due to low dietary vitamin B12. B12-mechanism-II requires <i>nhr-114</i> to activate Met/SAM cycle gene expression, the vitamin B12 transporter, <i>pmp-5</i>, and adjust influx and efflux of the cycle by activating msra-1 and repressing <i>cbs-1</i>, respectively. Taken together, Met/SAM cycle activity is sensed and transcriptionally adjusted to be in a tight metabolic regime."

The GRN has three layers (input, core, and output) and is topologically equivalent to bow-tie/hourglass structures prevalent among metabolic networks. To assess the functional importance of structural layers, we screened 80% of regulators and discovered 50 new aging genes, 86% with human orthologues. Genes essential for longevity-including ones involved in insulin-like signaling (ILS)-are at the core, indicating that GRN's structure is predictive of functionality. We used <i>invivo</i> reporters and a novel functional network covering 5,497 genetic interactions to make mechanistic predictions. We used genetic epistasis to test some of these predictions, uncovering a novel transcriptional regulator, <i>sup-37</i>, that works alongside DAF-16/FOXO.

In a quantitative proteomic study, we identified 86 proteins that were more or less abundant in long-lived daf-2 mutant worms than in wild-type worms. Genetic studies on a subset of these proteins indicated that they act in one or more processes regulated by DAF-2, including entry into the dauer developmental stage and aging. In particular, we discovered a compensatory mechanism activated in response to reduced DAF-2 signaling, which involves the protein phosphatase calcineurin."

Previous studies have clearly demonstrated that SAMS-1, a C. elegans homolog of mammalian SAMS, is critical for dietary restriction (DR)-induced longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans. In addition to SAMS-1, three other SAMS paralogs have been identified in C. elegans. However, their roles in longevity regulation have never been explored. Here, we show that depletion of sams-5, but not sams-3 or sams-4, can extend lifespan in worms. However, the phenotypes and expression pattern of sams-5 are distinct from sams-1, suggesting that these two SAMSs might regulate DR-induced longevity via different mechanisms. Through the genetic epistasis analysis, we have identified that sams-5 is required for DR-induced longevity in a pha-4/FOXA dependent manner."

Aberrant SREBP activity, however, can contribute to obesity, fatty liver disease, and insulin resistance, hallmarks of metabolic syndrome. Our studies identify a conserved regulatory circuit in which SREBP-1 controls genes in the one-carbon cycle, which produces the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe). Methylation is critical for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC), a major membrane component, and we find that blocking SAMe or PC synthesis in C. elegans, mouse liver, and human cells causes elevated SREBP-1-dependent transcription and lipid droplet accumulation. Distinct from negative regulation of SREBP-2 by cholesterol, our data suggest a feedback mechanism whereby maturation of nuclear, transcriptionally active SREBP-1 is controlled by levels of PC. Thus, nutritional or genetic conditions limiting SAMe or PC production may activate SREBP-1, contributing to human metabolic disorders."

The synthesis of SAM is catalyzed by SAM synthetase (SAMS), which transfers the adenosyl moiety of adenosine-5'-triphosphate to methionine. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, four sams family genes, sams-1, -3, -4 and -5, are predicted to encode SAMS proteins. However, their physiological roles remain unclear. Here we show that the four predicted SAMS proteins in fact have the ability to catalyze the formation of SAM in vitro, and revealed that only sams-1 mutant animals among the family genes exhibited a significant reduction in egg-laying. Using transgenic animals carrying a transcriptional reporter for each sams gene promoter, we observed that each sams promoter confers a distinct expression pattern with respect to tissue, time of expression and expression level (i.e. promoter specificity). Promoter-swap experiments revealed that the ectopic expression of SAMS-3, -4 or -5 driven by the sams-1 promoter completely rescued egg-laying in sams-1 mutants. These data indicate that SAMS protein function is conserved throughout the entire family."

Whereas myriad genes are known to affect the lifespan of model organisms, effects of such interventions on healthspan-the period of life where an animal is considered healthy, rather than merely alive-are less clear. To understand relationships between life- and healthspan, in recent years several platforms were developed with the purpose of assessing both readouts simultaneously. We here relied on one such platform, the WorMotel, to study effects of adulthood-restricted knock-down of 130 Caenorhabditis elegans genes on the locomotive health of the animals along their lifespans. We found that knock-down of six genes affected healthspan while lifespan remained unchanged. For two of these, F26A3.4 and chn-1, knock-down resulted in an improvement of healthspan. In follow-up experiments we showed that knockdown of F26A3.4 indeed improves locomotive health and muscle structure at old age."

To identify cholesterol-responsive proteins likely responsible for the larval arrest upon CS, a comparative proteomic analysis was performed between C. elegans grown in normal medium supplemented with cholesterol (CN) and those grown in medium not supplemented with cholesterol (cholesterol starvation, CS). Our analysis revealed significant change (more than 2.2-fold, p &lt; 0.05) in nine proteins upon CS. Six proteins were down-regulated [CE01270 (EEF-1A.1), CE08852 (SAMS-1), CE11068 (PMT-2), CE09015 (ACDH-1), CE12564 (R07H5.8), and CE09655 (RLA-0)], and three proteins were up-regulated [CE29645 (LEC-1), CE16576 (LEC-5), and CE01431 (NEX-1)]. RNAi phenotypes of two of the down-regulated genes, R07H5.8 (adenosine kinase) and rla-0 (ribosomal protein), in CN were similar to that of larval arrest in CS, and RNAi of a down-regulated gene, R07H5.8, in CS further enhanced the effects of CS, suggesting that down-regulation of these genes is likely responsible for the larval arrest in CS. All three up-regulated genes contain putative DAF-16 binding sites and mRNA levels of these three genes were all decreased in daf-16 mutants in CN, suggesting that DAF-16 activates expression of these genes."

In mammals, elucidating the effects and mechanisms of individual nutrients is challenging due to the complexity of both the animal and its diet. Here, we used an interspecies systems biology approach with Caenorhabditis elegans and two of its bacterial diets, Escherichia coli and Comamonas aquatica, to identify metabolites that affect the animal's gene expression and physiology. We identify vitamin B12 as the major dilutable metabolite provided by Comamonas aq. that regulates gene expression, accelerates development, and reduces fertility but does not affect lifespan. We find that vitamin B12 has a dual role in the animal: it affects development and fertility via the methionine/S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM) cycle and breaks down the short-chain fatty acid propionic acid, preventing its toxic buildup. Our interspecies systems biology approach provides a paradigm for understanding complex interactions between diet and physiology."

It primarily does so through the activity of the DAF-16 transcription factor (forkhead box O (FOXO) homologue), whose global targets were identified in Caenorhabditis elegans using whole-worm transcriptional analyses more than a decade ago. IIS and FOXO also regulate important neuronal and adult behavioural phenotypes, such as the maintenance of memory and axon regeneration with age, in both mammals and C. elegans, but the neuron-specific IIS/FOXO targets that regulate these functions are still unknown. By isolating adult C. elegans neurons for transcriptional profiling, we identified both the wild-type and IIS/FOXO mutant adult neuronal transcriptomes for the first time. IIS/FOXO neuron-specific targets are distinct from canonical IIS/FOXO-regulated longevity and metabolism targets, and are required for extended memory in IIS daf-2 mutants. The activity of the forkhead transcription factor FKH-9 in neurons is required for the ability of daf-2 mutants to regenerate axons with age, and its activity in non-neuronal tissues is required for the long lifespan of daf-2 mutants. Together, neuron-specific and canonical IIS/FOXO-regulated targets enable the coordinated extension of neuronal activities, metabolism, and longevity under low-insulin signalling conditions."

In response to harsh environmental conditions and pheromone signals, C. elegans larvae become the highly stress-resistant and long-lived dauer. Despite extensive studies of dauer formation pathways that integrate specific environmental cues and appear to depend on transcriptional reprogramming, the role of epigenetic regulation in dauer development has remained unclear. Here we report that BLMP-1, the BLIMP-1 ortholog, regulates dauer formation via epigenetic pathways; in the absence of TGF signaling (in daf-7 mutants), lack of blmp-1 caused lethality. Using this phenotype we screened 283 epigenetic factors, and identified lin-40, a homolog of metastasis associate protein MTA1, as an interactor of BLMP-1. The interaction between LIN-40 and BLMP-1 is conserved because mammalian homologs for both MTA1 and BLIMP1 could also interact. From microarray studies, we identified several downstream target genes of blmp-1: npr-3, nhr-23, ptr-4, and sams-1 Among them SAMS-1, S-adenosyl methionine synthase, is the key enzyme for production of SAM used in histone methylation. Indeed, blmp-1 is necessary for controlling histone methylation level in daf-7 mutants, suggesting BLMP-1 regulates the expression of SAMS-1, which in turn may regulate histone methylation and dauer formation. Our results reveal a new interaction between BLMP-1/BLIMP1 and LIN-40/MTA1, as well as potential epigenetic downstream pathways, whereby these proteins cooperate to regulate stress-specific developmental adaptations."

Here we report an exceptionally large and evolutionarily conserved protein LPD-3 in C. elegans that mediates lipid trafficking to confer cold resilience. We identify lpd-3 mutants in a mutagenesis screen for genetic suppressors of the lipid desaturase FAT-7. LPD-3 bridges the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membranes (PM), forming a structurally predicted hydrophobic tunnel for lipid trafficking. lpd-3 mutants exhibit abnormal phospholipid distribution, diminished FAT-7 abundance, organismic vulnerability to cold, and are rescued by Lecithin comprising unsaturated phospholipids. Deficient lpd-3 homologues in Zebrafish and mammalian cells cause defects similar to those observed in C. elegans. As mutations in BLTP1, the human orthologue of lpd-3, cause Alkuraya-Kucinskas syndrome, LPD-3 family proteins may serve as evolutionarily conserved highway bridges critical for ER-associated non-vesicular lipid trafficking and resilience to cold stress in eukaryotic cells."

In C. elegans, fmo-2 expression increases lifespan and healthspan downstream of multiple longevity-promoting pathways through an unknown mechanism. Here, we report that, beyond its classification as a xenobiotic enzyme, fmo-2 expression leads to rewiring of endogenous metabolism principally through changes in one carbon metabolism (OCM). These changes are likely relevant, as we find that genetically modifying OCM enzyme expression leads to alterations in longevity that interact with fmo-2 expression. Using computer modeling, we identify decreased methylation as the major OCM flux modified by FMO-2 that is sufficient to recapitulate its longevity benefits. We further find that tryptophan is decreased in multiple mammalian FMO overexpression models and is a validated substrate for FMO-2. Our resulting model connects a single enzyme to two previously unconnected key metabolic pathways and provides a framework for the metabolic interconnectivity of longevity-promoting pathways such as dietary restriction. FMOs are well-conserved enzymes that are also induced by lifespan-extending interventions in mice, supporting a conserved and important role in promoting health and longevity through metabolic remodeling."
NA,WBPaper00058042,International Worm Meeting,2019,WormCat: an online tool for categorizing and visualizing gene set enrichments from expression profiling and phenotypic screening data.,"Holdorf, Amy|Higgins, Daniel|Hart, Anne|Boag, Peter|Walhout, A.J. Marion|Walker, Amy","The emergence large sets of gene regulation data has revealed the need for improved tools to 1) identify enriched functional gene categories and 2) visualize enrichment patterns across comparative datasets. Gene ontogeny enrichment (GO) has several limitations for C. elegansanalysis. First, around 30% of C. elegans genes are not represented. Second, it is difficult to compare multiple GO analyses. To allow visualization and categorization of C. elegansgene sets from RNA sequencing or genetic screening data, we have developed a web-based tool, WormCat, that uses a near complete functional and molecular annotation of C. elegans genes to determine category enrichment. Then WormCat provides a scaled heat map for visualization along with enrichment statistics and annotation of each input gene. We have developed two annotation strategies: (1) a physiology-first annotation list using phenotype information from Wormbase and (2) a molecular function annotation list. In the physiology-first list, each gene is annotated by three nested categories (e.g., Stress response: pathogen: CUB protein) with enrichment scores generated at each level, allowing both broad (Cat1) and more detailed analysis (Cat2, Cat3). We have tested WormCat on different published datasets and found that WormCat identifies major GO categories and also provides additional information for interpreting phenotypes or predicting biological function. In one example, using RNA-seq data from the knockdown of sams-1, we found that WormCat identified 40 genes with functions in Metabolism: lipid(p < 6.0 x10-11).  GO returned lipid metabolism; however, it identified only 26 genes with 23% having little clear relationship to lipid metabolism. This shows that Worm Cat can dramatically improve on GO analysis.  In addition, we have identified novel regulated categories from spermatogenic gene sets (Ortiz et al. G3, 2014). Within the spermatogenic gene sets, the Cytoskeleton enrichment is 1.0x10-14 for Cat1, Cytoskeleton: Microtubuleis 1x10-22 for Cat2 and Cytoskeleton: Microtubule: tau tubulin kinaseis 4.5x10-29 for Cat3. A single tau tubulin kinase, spe-6, has been previously identified as important for major sperm protein assembly (Varkey et al., Genetics, 1993). Our enrichment results suggest this entire gene class may have important functions in sperm development. Thus, WormCat is a powerful tool that will allow sophisticated analysis of gene enrichment in different types ofC. elegansdatasets."
NA,WBPaper00062825,International Worm Meeting,2021,Identifying Metabolic Alterations That Activate the UPR-ER in vivo,"Xu, Jiaming|Taubert, Stefan","Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress due to protein misfolding is observed in many diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and metabolic diseases. ER homeostasis can be restored by activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR-ER), which alleviates the molecular stress or induces cell death when damage is too severe. In higher eukaryotes, the UPR consists of three branches: The Inositol-Requiring-Enzyme 1 (IRE-1) branch, the protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PEK-1) branch, and the Activating Transcription Factor 6 (ATF-6) branch. When misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER lumen, these sensors activate downstream effectors, which together attenuate global translation and transcriptionally upregulate genes that restore homeostasis. Interestingly, abnormal membrane lipid composition also induces the UPR-ER, independent of protein misfolding. However, to date we lack a global view of genetic perturbations that activate the UPR-ER in metazoans. To identify proteotoxicity-independent metabolic pathways that affect ER homeostasis, I used RNA interference (RNAi) to inactivate 1247 metabolic genes in Caenorhabditis elegans with the IRE-1 branch specific transcriptional reporter, hsp-4p::gfp. After screening and rigorous validation, I obtained 34 high-confidence xbp-1-dependent hits that also activate the PEK-1 branch. Next, I used quantitative real-time PCR to show that 11 of 15 tested RNAi clones induce the endogenous UPR-ER in wild-type worms. Then I tested whether dietary choline supplementation, which suppresses UPR-ER in worms defective for phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis pathway, is sufficient to suppress UPR-ER activation in our hits. Of the 34 hits, 3 were partially rescued by dietary supplementation of choline along with the complete rescue of sams-1 RNAi-treated animals, suggesting majority of the hits does not activate the UPR-ER via defective PC synthesis. Finally, I performed follow-up studies on one of the hit pathways on DNA replication. In early embryos, DNA replication stress induces UPR-ER activation, but not the mechanistically distinct cytosolic or mitochondrial UPRs, in a partially ire-1-, xbp-1-independent manner. This suggests that replication stress does not trigger global protein misfolding. Interestingly, genomic instability caused by loss of DNA repair pathways such as mismatch repair, nucleotide excision repair, and cohesin, which is essential for proper chromosome segregation, did not activate the UPR-ER, suggesting that molecular events specific to replication stress activate hsp-4 and the UPR-ER in the embryo. In sum, by identifying new genes that affect UPR-ER homeostasis in C. elegans, my project provides new insights into UPR-ER regulation and may serve as a starting point for the discovery of drug targets for human diseases featuring UPR-ER dysfunction."

With age, there was a decreased abundance of proteins functioning in transcription termination, mRNA degradation, mRNA stability, protein synthesis, and proteasomal function. Furthermore, there was altered S-adenosyl methionine metabolism as well as a decreased abundance of the S-adenosyl methionine synthetase (SAMS-1) protein. Other aging-related changes included alterations in free fatty acid levels and composition, decreased levels of ribosomal proteins, decreased levels of NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1), a shift in the cellular redox state, an increase in sorbitol content, alterations in free amino acid levels, and indications of altered muscle function and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) homeostasis. There were also decreases in pyrimidine and purine metabolite levels, most markedly nitrogenous bases. Supplementing the culture medium with cytidine (a pyrimidine nucleoside) or hypoxanthine (a purine base) increased lifespan slightly, suggesting that aging-induced alterations in ribonucleotide metabolism affect lifespan. An age-related increase in body size, lipotoxicity from ectopic yolk lipoprotein accumulation, a decline in NAD(+) levels, and mitochondrial electron transport chain dysfunction may explain many of these changes. In addition, dietary restriction in aged worms resulting from sarcopenia of the pharyngeal pump likely decreases the abundance of SAMS-1, possibly leading to decreased phosphatidylcholine levels, larger lipid droplets, and ER and mitochondrial stress. The complementary use of proteomics and metabolomics yielded unique insights into the molecular processes altered with age in C. elegans."

Vitamin B12 is essential for the growth of this worm, which contains two cobalamin-dependent enzymes, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and methionine synthase. A full complement of gene homologs encoding the enzymes associated with the mammalian intercellular metabolic processes of vitamin B12 is identified in the genome of C elegans However, this worm has no orthologs of the vitamin B12-binders that participate in human intestinal absorption and blood circulation. When the worm is treated with a vitamin B12-deficient diet for five generations (15 days), it readily develops vitamin B12 deficiency, which induces worm phenotypes (infertility, delayed growth, and shorter lifespan) that resemble the symptoms of mammalian vitamin B12 deficiency. Such phenotypes associated with vitamin B12 deficiency were readily induced in the worm."

However, the networks that control dietary responses remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we combine forward and reverse genetic screens to delineate a network of 184 genes that affect the C. elegans dietary response to Comamonas DA1877 bacteria. We find that perturbation of a mitochondrial network composed of enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism and the TCA cycle affects the dietary response. In humans, mutations in the corresponding genes cause inborn diseases of amino acid metabolism, most of which are treated by dietary intervention. We identify several transcription factors (TFs) that mediate the changes in gene expression upon metabolic network perturbations. Altogether, our findings unveil a transcriptional response system that is poised to sense dietary cues and metabolic imbalances, illustrating extensive communication between metabolic networks in the mitochondria and gene regulatory networks in the nucleus."

Here, we examined the role of sams-1 in mediating the anti-aging effect of DR in C. elegans. sams-1 has previously been identified as a DR-responsive gene in C. elegans, as its expression level is significantly reduced in DR animals. Moreover, reduction in the expression of sams-1 has been shown to extend lifespan. However, the molecular mechanisms by which sams-1 influences longevity remain unknown. sams-1 encodes a S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) synthetase that catalyzes the biosynthesis of the universal methyl group donor S-adenosyl methionine (SAM). In this study, we found that SAMS-1 functions primarily in the intestine to influence longevity, and that dietary supplementation of SAM significantly reversed the lifespan phenotypes of sams-1 mutants. We also found that over-expression of sams-1 completely eliminates the longevity effects of DR. Most intriguingly, we found that SAMS-1 undergoes a rapid subcellular re-localization in the intestine, followed by a reduction in overall protein level in response to nutrient changes or TOR knockdown. These new findings strongly suggest that SAMS-1 may act downstream of TOR signaling to mediate the anti-aging effect of DR. To identify the downstream effectors that mediate the longevity effects of sams-1 mutants, we examined the effects of various methyltransferases on lifespan. Our preliminary results suggest that SAMS-1 might influence longevity by modulating RNA maturation, histone methylation, and phospholipid synthesis."

The accumulation of intracellular damages might cause a progressively decline of cellular functions, leading to increased pathological conditions that is often observed with age. Autophagy has been recognized as a key cellular mechanism in maintaining cellular homeostasis through the degradation of aggregated proteins and defective organelles. Indeed, several pieces of evidence has supported that autophagy activation is beneficial for lifespan or health span in various model organisms. Dietary restriction (DR) is the most robust intervention for enhancing lifespan and health span. DR could upregulate autophagy activity in animals. Therefore, it has been suggested that autophagy plays a major role in DR-induced longevity. In fact, studies in C. elegans have indicated that autophagy is required in DR-induced longevity. Previously, we have demonstrated that sams-1, S-adenosyl methionine synthetase-1, is a key regulator in lifespan extension induced by DR. Therefore, we asked whether autophagy is also required in SAMS-1-mediated lifespan extension in C. elegans. In this study, we have shown that knockout or RNAi knockdown of SAMS-1 significantly activates autophagy flux. Meanwhile, we found that RNAi knockdown of sams-1 largely enhances the expression level and nuclear localization of HLH-30/TFEB, a master transcription factor for autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis. Furthermore, nuclear localization of HLH-30 in sams-1 RNAi mutants could be abolished by extra supplementation of SAM (S-adenosyl methionine). Thus, our observations have suggested that SAM-dependent reaction is involved in the regulation of HLH-30 activity. In order to identify the sams-1 effectors that could regulate the translocation of HLH-30, we have performed a protein methyltransferase RNAi screen in C. elegans. Through the screen, we have found that set-2 could modulate mRNA expression and the subcellular distribution of HLH-30. Our findings indicate that elevating autophagy activity is required for sams-1-mediated lifespan extension and that SAMS-1 might modulate HLH-30/TFEB activity through regulating SET-2-dependent methylation."

A variety of DR regimens have been described in species ranging from yeast to mammals. However, whether different DR regimens extend lifespan via universal, distinct, or overlapping pathways is still an open question. Here we examine the genetic pathways that mediate longevity by different DR regimens in Caenorhabditis elegans. We have previously shown that the low-energy sensing AMP-activated protein kinase AMPK/aak-2 and the Forkhead transcription factor FoxO/daf-16 are necessary for longevity induced by a DR regimen that we developed (sDR). Here we find that AMPK and FoxO are necessary for longevity induced by another DR regimen, but are dispensable for the lifespan extension induced by two different DR methods. Intriguingly, AMPK is also necessary for the lifespan extension elicited by resveratrol, a natural polyphenol that mimics some aspects of DR. Conversely, we test if genes previously reported to mediate longevity by a variety of DR methods are necessary for sDR-induced longevity. Although clk-1, a gene involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis, is also required for sDR-induced lifespan extension, we find that four other genes (sir-2.1, FoxA/pha-4, skn-1, and hsf-1) are all dispensable for longevity induced by sDR. Consistent with the observation that different DR methods extend lifespan by mostly independent genetic mechanisms, we find that the effects on lifespan of two different DR regimens are additive. Understanding the genetic network by which different DR regimens extend lifespan has important implications for harnessing the full benefits of DR on lifespan and healthspan."

Metformin also increases lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans cocultured with Escherichia coli. This bacterium exerts complex nutritional and pathogenic effects on its nematode predator/host that impact health and aging. We report that metformin increases lifespan by altering microbial folate and methionine metabolism. Alterations in metformin-induced longevity by mutation of worm methionine synthase (metr-1) and S-adenosylmethionine synthase (sams-1) imply metformin-induced methionine restriction in the host, consistent with action of this drug as a dietary restriction mimetic. Metformin increases or decreases worm lifespan, depending on E. coli strain metformin sensitivity and glucose concentration. In mammals, the intestinal microbiome influences host metabolism, including development of metabolic disease. Thus, metformin-induced alteration of microbial metabolism could contribute to therapeutic efficacy-and also to its side effects, which include folate deficiency and gastrointestinal upset."

Such deficiency in infants has long been known to increase the propensity to develop obesity and diabetes later in life through unclear mechanisms. Here, we establish a Caenorhabditis elegans model to study how early-life B12 impacts adult health. We find that early-life B12 deficiency causes increased lipogenesis and lipid peroxidation in adult worms, which in turn induces germline defects through ferroptosis. Mechanistically, we show the central role of the methionine cycle-SBP-1/SREBP1-lipogenesis axis in programming adult traits by early-life B12. Moreover, SBP-1/SREBP1 participates in a crucial feedback loop with NHR-114/HNF4 to maintain cellular B12 homeostasis. Inhibition of SBP-1/SREBP1-lipogenesis signaling and ferroptosis later in life can reverse disorders in adulthood when B12 cannot. Overall, this study provides mechanistic insights into the life-course effects of early-life B12 on the programming of adult health and identifies potential targets for future interventions for adiposity and infertility."

The synthesis of SAM is catalyzed by SAM synthetase (SAMS), which transfers the adenosyl portion of ATP to methionine. Here, we investigate the physiological roles of the SAMS proteins in C. elegans by using loss-of-function mutants of sams genes, sams-1, -3, -4 and -5. Among sams mutants, only sams-1 mutant exhibited a marked reduction in brood size. To investigate the role of SAMS-1 in the regulation of brood size, we examined the expression pattern of sams-1 using transgenic worms expressing GFP proteins under control of endogenous sams-1 promoter. Unexpectedly, sams-1 was expressed abundantly in the intestine and the body wall muscle, but not in the germline. Next, we examined whether SAM synthetic activity of sams-1 is involved in the regulation of brood size. The reduction of brood size in sams-1 mutant was efficiently rescued by over-expressing wild-type SAMS-1, but not an enzymatically inactive one. These results indicate that the brood size was modulated in SAM synthetic activity-dependent manner. Collectively, these data raise the possibility that SAM in the intestine and the body wall muscle might play an important role in maintaining the brood size in C. elegans."

Although the regulation of glycogen turnover has been well studied, the effects of glycogen on aging and disease development have been largely unexplored. In Caenorhabditis elegans fed a high sugar diet, glycogen potentiates resistance to oxidants, but paradoxically, shortens lifespan. Depletion of glycogen by oxidants or inhibition of glycogen synthesis extends the lifespan of worms by an AMPK-dependent mechanism. Thus, glycogen is not merely an inert storage molecule, but also an active regulator of energy balance and aging. Its depletion by oxidants may be beneficial in the treatment of hyperglycemia and glycogen-related diseases."

Recently, high-throughput methods enabled the capture of mammalian RNA-binding proteomes. To gain insight into the role of Arabidopsis thaliana RBPs at the systems level, we have employed interactome capture techniques using cells from different ecotypes grown in cultures and leaves. In vivo UV-crosslinking of RNA to RBPs, oligo(dT) capture and mass spectrometry yielded 1,145 different proteins including 550 RBPs that either belong to the functional category 'RNA-binding', have known RNA-binding domains or have orthologs identified in mammals, C. elegans, or S. cerevisiae in addition to 595 novel candidate RBPs. We noted specific subsets of RBPs in cultured cells and leaves and a comparison of Arabidopsis, mammalian, C. elegans, and S. cerevisiae RBPs reveals a common set of proteins with a role in intermediate metabolism, as well as distinct differences suggesting that RBPs are also species and tissue specific. This study provides a foundation for studies that will advance our understanding of the biological significance of RBPs in plant developmental and stimulus specific responses."

However, the efficacy of orthology prediction depends on the accuracy of gene model predictions, an ongoing process, and orthology-prediction algorithms have also been updated over time. Here we present OrthoList 2 (OL2), a new comparative genomic analysis between <i>C. elegans</i> and humans, and the first assessment of how changes over time affect the landscape of predicted orthologs between two species. Although we find that updates to the orthology-prediction methods significantly changed the landscape of <i>C. elegans-</i>human orthologs predicted by individual programs, and, unexpectedly, reduced agreement amongst them, we also show that our meta-analysis approach &quot;buffered&quot; against changes in gene content. We show that adding results from more programs did not lead to many additions to the list, and discuss reasons to avoid assigning &quot;scores&quot; based on support by individual orthology prediction programs, the treatment of &quot;legacy&quot; genes no longer predicted by these programs, and the practical difficulties of updating due to encountering deprecated, changed, or retired gene IDs. In addition, we consider what other criteria may support claims of orthology, and alternative approaches to find potential orthologs that elude identification by these programs. Finally, we created a new web-based tool that allows for rapid searches of OL2 by gene identifiers, protein domains (InterPro and SMART), or human-disease associations (OMIM), and also includes available RNAi resources to facilitate potential translational cross-species studies."

SAM is produced by the 1-carbon cycle and this interaction provides a key link between metabolic status and transcriptional control. We previously found that RNA interference with sams-1, one of the four SAM synthases in Caenorhabditis elegans, reduces SAM levels as well histone H3 lysine 4 methylation (H3K4me3) in intestinal cells. sams-1 deficient animals also have altered stress responses. They are unable to accumulate H3K4me3 at promoters of bacterial response genes, upregulate these genes or survive pathogenic challenge. In contrast, sams-1 animals have enhanced survival during heat shock and regulate heat shock gene expression normally, although metabolic gene expression is broadly downregulated. Several lines of evidence suggest SAM from a distinct synthase may be important. First, interference with the H3K4me3 transferase set-16 had reduced survival in heat shock. Second, H3K4me3 levels recovered in heat shock in sams-1 animals, suggesting SAM from a distinct synthase and/or activity histone modifying enzymes could contribute to this stress response. Here, we show that sams-1 and sams-4 have distinct roles in the heat shock response, showing that the enzymatic source of SAM is a critical predictor of SAM function. Loss of sams-4 is distinct from sams-1 in several critical areas. sams-4 animals survive poorly after heat shock and is necessary for the recovery of H3K4me3 after heat shock. Next, sams-4(RNAi) animals do not exhibit the same reductions in metabolic gene expression during heat shock. Finally, sams-1 and sams-4 RNAi animals have distinct patterns of H3K4me3 in both basal and heat shocked conditions in CUT&amp;Tag assay measuring genome wide H3K4me3, with sams-1 animals losing enrichment at metabolic genes, similar to reductions in these genes in RNA seq. Taken together, this shows that the enzymatic source of SAM influences H3K4me3 patterns, gene expression patterns and physiological response to stress."

An emerging theme in DMD pathophysiology is an intramuscular deficit in the gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S). Here we show that the C. elegans DMD model displays reduced levels of H<sub>2</sub>S and expression of genes required for sulfur metabolism. These reductions can be offset by increasing bioavailability of sulfur containing amino acids (L-methionine, L-homocysteine, L-cysteine, L-glutathione, and L-taurine), augmenting healthspan primarily via improved calcium regulation, mitochondrial structure and delayed muscle cell death. Additionally, we show distinct differences in preservation mechanisms between sulfur amino acid vs H<sub>2</sub>S administration, despite similarities in required health-preserving pathways. Our results suggest that the H<sub>2</sub>S deficit in DMD is likely caused by altered sulfur metabolism and that modulation of this pathway may improve DMD muscle health via multiple evolutionarily conserved mechanisms."
NA,WBPaper00052390,International Worm Meeting,2017,Differential requirements for the methyl donor SAM in stress-induced gene expression.,"Ding, Wei|Higgins, Daniel|Pukkila-Worley, Read|Walker, Amy","Transcriptional processes are tightly linked to metabolic products. For example, the 1-carbon (1CC) cycle produces SAM (s-adenosylmethionine), the methyl donor used for histone and nucleic acid modification. While 1CC disruption has been proposed to broadly affect epigenetic processes, it is surprising that shifts in SAM levels affect specific methylation events, such as activating H3K4 methylation, suggesting that changes in SAM metabolism may affect specific genes or biological processes. Because the mammalian H3K4 methyltransferase (HMT) family is complex, it has also been difficult to discern specific roles for individual HMTs. Using C. elegans, we found that reducing SAM caused defects in H3K4me3 accumulation on promoters of selected infection response genes during pathogen exposure, that induction of these genes failed and that these animals had reduced survival. Furthermore, set-16/MLL, appeared to have critical role in this process. This suggests SAM may be important for stress responsive transcription and that distinct H3K4 methyl transferases may have specific roles. To test this model, we treated C. elegans with three stresses, bacterial, detoxification and heat, then examined survival and genome wide mRNA expression patterns in animals with low SAM (sams-1(RNAi)), or after knockdown of H3K4 HMTs set-2/SET1 or set-16/MLL. We found that transcriptional responses to bacterial or detoxification stress were blunted in sams-1(RNAi) animals. set-2/SET1 or set-16/MLL RNAi had negligible effects on in control animals, however, elicited distinct effects in response to bacterial, detoxification stress. set-2/SET1 appears less broadly required during bacterial or detoxification stress. Many bacterial or detoxification stress genes were also strongly attenuated after set-16/MLL knockdown. Canonical heat shock gene expression, however, increased normally in response to heat after sams-1, set-2 and set-16 RNAi. Finally, our biological assays revealed two important effects. First, sams-1, set-2/SET1 and set-16/MLL RNAi animals all died rapidly from the pathogen, despite variations in transcriptional responses. Interestingly, other 1CC genes, such the SAM synthases sams-2 and sams-3, are normally induced in response to a pathogen, but fail in sams-1, set-2/SET1 and set-16/MLL RNAi animals, suggesting feedback loops maintaining 1CC function may be critical for pathogenic challenge. Finally, set-16/MLL was sensitive to all three stresses, whereas set-2/SET1 animals survived normally on the detoxification agent and after heat shock. Thus, set-16/MLL may have a more general role in stress responsive transcription. Our data suggests that depletion of SAM could reduce the ability of a tissue to respond to stress, thereby increasing potential for injury and exacerbating disease progression."

The causal link between phospholipid homeostasis and ferroptosis is incompletely understood. Here, we reveal that spin-4, a previously identified regulator of the ""B12-one-carbon cycle-phosphatidylcholine (PC)"" pathway, sustains germline development and fertility by ensuring PC sufficiency in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Mechanistically, SPIN-4 regulates lysosomal activity which is required for B12-associated PC synthesis. PC deficiency-induced sterility can be rescued by reducing the levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), reactive oxygen species (ROS) , and redox-active iron, which indicates that the sterility is mediated by germline ferroptosis. These results highlight the critical role of PC homeostasis in ferroptosis susceptibility and offer a new target for pharmacological approaches."

Both processes are regulated by constant targeting of proteins into the organelle. Thus, mitochondrial protein import sets the pace for mitochondrial abundance and function. However, our understanding of mitochondrial protein translocation as a regulator of longevity remains enigmatic. Here, we targeted the main protein import translocases and assessed their contribution to mitochondrial abundance and organismal physiology. We find that reduction in cellular mitochondrial load through mitochondrial protein import system suppression, referred to as MitoMISS, elicits a distinct longevity paradigm. We show that MitoMISS triggers the mitochondrial unfolded protein response, orchestrating an adaptive reprogramming of metabolism. Glycolysis and de novo serine biosynthesis are causatively linked to longevity, whilst mitochondrial chaperone induction is dispensable for lifespan extension. Our findings extent the pro-longevity role of UPR<sup>mt</sup> and provide insight, relevant to the metabolic alterations that promote or undermine survival and longevity."

Their defences drive innovation in virulence mechanisms, leading to never-ending cycles of co-evolution in both hosts and pathogens. A full understanding of host immunity therefore requires examination of pathogen virulence strategies. Here, we take advantage of the well-studied innate immune system of Caenorhabditis elegans to dissect the action of two virulence factors from its natural fungal pathogen Drechmeria coniospora. We show that these two enterotoxins have strikingly different effects when expressed individually in the nematode epidermis. One is able to interfere with diverse aspects of host cell biology, altering vesicle trafficking and preventing the key STAT-like transcription factor STA-2 from activating defensive antimicrobial peptide gene expression. The second increases STA-2 levels in the nucleus, modifies the nucleolus, and, potentially as a consequence of a host surveillance mechanism, causes increased defence gene expression. Our results highlight the remarkably complex and potentially antagonistic mechanisms that come into play in the interaction between co-evolved hosts and pathogens."
NA,WBPaper00047716,International Worm Meeting,2015,lpin-1 is necessary for low-PC activation of SBP-1/SREBP-1.,"Smulan, Lorissa|Bozonnet, Noemie|Walker, Amy","Decreases in s-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), the major methyl donor, or phosphatidylcholine (PC), a methylated phospholipid, are associated with lipid accumulation in mammalian metabolic disease.  However, the molecular mechanisms that link these metabolites to pathways stimulating lipogenesis are not fully understood.  Using C. elegans and mammalian models, we previously found that activity of a lipogenic transcription factor, SBP-1/SREBP-1, was increased when SAMe and PC levels fell.  For example, knockdown of the SAMe synthase sams-1 decreases both SAMe and PC and results in upregulation of SBP-1 target genes such fat-7.  fat-7 expression is returned to wild type levels when PC biosynthesis is rescued by diet. In order to identify additional effectors, we performed a small scale  RNAi screen for factors that could activate SBP-1 in a PC dependent manner by comparing fat-7::GFP levels in normal and low PC background (sams-1(lof)).  We reasoned that factors affected by low PC in this pathway might be involved in intracellular transport (COP II or COP I components), act in synthesis of complex lipids (phospholipids, ceremides, sphingolipids), regulate phospholipid transport (flippases, lipid transfer proteins) or function in phospholipid-based signaling pathways (phospholipases).  In order to insure complete coverage in our screen, we combined clones from the Ahringer and Orfeome collections and made RNAi targeting vectors for unrepresented genes.We identified multiple RNAi clones that increased fat-7::GFP in a sams-1-dependent fashion, suggesting they could be linked to low-PC activation of SBP-1.  As secondary screens, we asked which candidates had similar effects on endogenous fat-7, and finally, determined those that caused increases in nuclear localization of a translational fusion of GFP::SBP-1.  Through this process we identified two genes, lpin-1 and arf-1.2, as potential effectors of low-PC effects on SBP-1. lpin-1 is a phosphatidic acid phosphatase important for triglyceride synthesis and lipid droplet function.  arf-1.2 is a small GTPase that regulates COP I Golgi to ER traffic and is also important for lipid droplet formation.  We extended these studies to mammalian cells and found that siRNA of LPIN1 or ARF1 is sufficient to activate SREBP-1 and that LPIN1 is required for SREBP-1 activation when PC biosynthesis is inhibited.  Finally, we find that both inhibition of PC biosynthesis and LPIN1 knockdown decrease levels of active ARF1.  This suggests a pathway in which LPIN1 acts between signals from PC levels and regulation of ARF1 activity in the Golgi to affect activation of SBP-1/SREBP-1."

Fluctuation in SAMe impacts phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis in the liver and several mammalian studies correlate SAMe levels with variations in DNA or histone methylation.  In addition, low SAMe is associated with with lipid accumulation, increased tissue injury and immune responses in mammalian metabolic diseases, such as fatty liver disease.  However, molecular connections between SAMe limitation, individual methyltransferases and these phenotypes are unclear.  We had previously found that knockdown or mutation in the C. elegans SAMe synthase sams-1 exhibited lipid accumulation and now we find that the low SAMe can also associated with activation or attenuation Caenorhabditis elegans immune responses depending on bacterial food source.  On non-pathogenic Eschericia coli diets, innate immune pathways are stimulated with increased expression of genes associated with defense against bacterial pathogens and constituative phosphorylation of PMK-1, a p38 MAP kinase essential for innate immune responses.  Dietary rescue experiments show that this activation of innate immunity is downstream of methylation-dependent PC production.However, when challenged with pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa, sams-1(lof) animals die rapidly, despite activation of protective MAPK pathways.  We find that distinct SAMe-dependent mechanisms are linked to Pseudomonas-specific responses in sams-1 animals.  C. elegans undertakes a broad transcriptional response to pathogenic bacteria and we find that low SAMe restricts an activating histone methylation mark, H3K4me3, on promoters of Pseudomonas-responsive genes and limits induction of these pathogen responsive genes.  Furthermore, we find the H3K4 methyltransferase set-16/MLL is critical for transcriptional responses to bacterial stress.  Thus, our studies provide molecular links between SAMe levels and innate immune functions and suggest that a primary effect of SAMe depletion is limitation of stress-induced gene expression."

The use of anthelmintic drugs, such as Ivermectin (IVM), to control these parasites has led to widespread drug resistance. Identifying genetic markers of resistance in parasitic nematodes can be challenging, but the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans provides a suitable model. In this study, we aimed to analyze the transcriptomes of adult C. elegans worms of the N2 strain exposed to the anthelmintic drug Ivermectin (IVM), and compare them to those of the resistant strain DA1316 and the recently identified Abamectin Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) on chromosome V. We exposed pools of 300 adult N2 worms to IVM (10-7 and 10-8 M) for 4 hours at 20&#xb0;C, extracted total RNA and sequenced it on the Illumina NovaSeq6000 platform. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were determined using an in-house pipeline. The DEGs were compared to genes from a previous microarray study on IVM-resistant C. elegans and Abamectin-QTL. Our results revealed 615 DEGs (183 up-regulated and 432 down-regulated genes) from diverse gene families in the N2 C. elegans strain. Of these DEGs, 31 overlapped with genes from IVM-exposed adult worms of the DA1316 strain. We identified 19 genes, including the folate transporter (folt-2) and the transmembrane transporter (T22F3.11), which exhibited an opposite expression in N2 and the DA1316 strain and were deemed potential candidates. Additionally, we compiled a list of potential candidates for further research including T-type calcium channel (cca-1), potassium chloride cotransporter (kcc-2), as well as other genes such as glutamate-gated channel (glc-1) that mapped to the Abamectin-QTL."

Upon lipid bilayer stress, the endoplasmic reticulum mounts a stress response similar to the unfolded protein response. However, only a few genes are known to regulate lipid bilayer stress. We performed a suppressor screen that combined the auxin-inducible degradation (AID) system with conventional RNAi in <i>C. elegans</i> to identify members of the lipid bilayer stress response. AID-mediated degradation of the mediator MDT-15, a protein required for the upregulation of fatty acid desaturases, induced the activation of lipid bilayer stress-sensitive reporters. We screened through most <i>C. elegans</i> kinases and transcription factors by feeding RNAi. We discovered nine genes that suppressed the lipid bilayer stress response in <i>C. elegans</i> These suppressor genes included <i>drl-1</i>/MAP3K3, <i>gsk-3</i>/GSK3, <i>let-607</i>/CREB3, <i>ire-1</i>/IRE1, and <i>skn-1</i>/NRF1,2,3. Our candidate suppressor genes suggest a network of transcription factors and the integration of multiple tissues for a centralized lipotoxicity response in the intestine. Thus, we demonstrated proof-of-concept for combining AID and RNAi as a new screening strategy and identified eight conserved genes that had not previously been implicated in the lipid bilayer stress response."

By screening for novel paqr-2 suppressors, we identified mutations in genes involved in phosphatidylcholine synthesis (cept-1, pcyt-1 and sams-1) and fatty acid metabolism (ech-7, hacd-1, mdt-15, nhr-49 and sbp-1). We then show genetic evidence that paqr-2, phosphatidylcholines, sbp-1 and 9-desaturases form a cold adaptation pathway that regulates the increase in unsaturated fatty acids necessary to retain membrane fluidity at low temperatures. This model is supported by the observations that the paqr-2 suppressors normalize the levels of saturated fatty acids, and that low concentrations of detergents that increase membrane fluidity can rescue the paqr-2 mutant."

From a saturated forward genetic screen of 6.7 x 10(5) mutagenized haploid genomes, we isolated 118 mutants with supersized intestinal LDs often reaching 10 m. These mutants define nine novel complementation groups, in addition to four known genes (maoc-1, dhs-28, daf-22 &amp; prx-10). The nine groups are named drop (lipid droplet abnormal) and categorized into four classes. Class I mutants drop-5 &amp; drop-9, similar to prx-10, are up-regulated in ACS-22-DGAT-2-dependent LD growth, resistant to LD hydrolysis, and defective in peroxisome import. Class II mutants drop-2, drop-3, drop-6 &amp; drop-7, are up-regulated in LD growth, resistant to LD hydrolysis, but not defective in peroxisome import. Class III mutants drop-1 &amp; drop-8 are neither up-regulated in LD growth nor resistant to LD hydrolysis, but seemingly up-regulated in LD fusion. Class IV mutant drop-4 is cloned as sams-1 and, different to the other three classes, is ACS-22-independent and hydrolysis-resistant. These four classes of supersized LD mutants should be valuable for mechanistic studies of LD cellular processes including growth, hydrolysis, and fusion."

To ask whether our current view of aging has been affected by selection bias, and to deepen our understanding of known longevity pathways, we screened a genomic Caenorhabditis elegans RNAi library for clones that extend lifespan. We identified 23 new longevity genes affecting signal transduction, the stress response, gene expression, and metabolism and assigned these genes to specific longevity pathways. Our most important findings are (i) that dietary restriction extends C. elegans' lifespan by down-regulating expression of key genes, including a gene required for methylation of many macromolecules, (ii) that integrin signaling is likely to play a general, evolutionarily conserved role in lifespan regulation, and (iii) that specific lipophilic hormones may influence lifespan in a DAF-16/FOXO-dependent fashion. Surprisingly, of the new genes that have conserved sequence domains, only one could not be associated with a known longevity pathway. Thus, our current view of the genetics of aging has probably not been distorted substantially by selection bias."

In humans, several age-related diseases are associated with aberrant protein folding or aggregation, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer''s, Parkinson''s, and Huntington''s diseases. We report here that dietary restriction dramatically suppresses age-associated paralysis in three nematode models of proteotoxicity. Similar to its longevity-enhancing properties, dietary restriction protects against proteotoxicity by a mechanism distinct from reduced insulin/IGF-1-like signaling. Instead, the heat shock transcription factor, hsf-1, is required for enhanced thermotolerance, suppression of proteotoxicity, and life span extension by dietary restriction. These findings demonstrate that dietary restriction confers a general protective effect against proteotoxicity and promotes longevity by a mechanism involving hsf-1."

SAM is synthesized from methionine, which is imported or generated through the 1-carbon cycle (1CC). Alterations in 1CC function have clear effects on lifespan and stress responses, but the wide distribution of this modification has made identification of specific mechanistic links difficult. Exploiting a dynamic stress-induced transcription model, we find that two SAM synthases in Caenorhabditis elegans, SAMS-1 and SAMS-4, contribute differently to modification of H3K4me3, gene expression and survival. We find that sams-4 enhances H3K4me3 in heat shocked animals lacking sams-1, however, sams-1 cannot compensate for sams-4, which is required to survive heat stress. This suggests that the regulatory functions of SAM depend on its enzymatic source and that provisioning of SAM may be an important regulatory step linking 1CC function to phenotypes in aging and stress."

As such, changes in the expression of metabolic genes and the profiles of amino acid levels are features associated with aging animals. We previously reported that the levels of most amino acids decline with age in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Glycine, in contrast, substantially accumulates in aging C. elegans. In this study we show that this is coupled to a decrease in gene expression of enzymes important for glycine catabolism. We further show that supplementation of glycine significantly prolongs C. elegans lifespan, and early adulthood is important for its salutary effects. Moreover, supplementation of glycine ameliorates specific transcriptional changes that are associated with aging. Glycine feeds into the methionine cycle. We find that mutations in components of this cycle, methionine synthase (metr-1) and S-adenosylmethionine synthetase (sams-1), completely abrogate glycine-induced lifespan extension. Strikingly, the beneficial effects of glycine supplementation are conserved when we supplement with serine, which also feeds into the methionine cycle. RNA-sequencing reveals a similar transcriptional landscape in serine- and glycine-supplemented worms both demarked by widespread gene repression. Taken together, these data uncover a novel role of glycine in the deceleration of aging through its function in the methionine cycle."

The main responses of rodent models to MR are well-documented in adipose tissue (AT) and liver, which have reduced mass and improved insulin sensitivity, respectively. Recently, molecular mechanisms that improve healthspan have been identified in both organs during MR. In fat, MR induced a futile lipid cycle concomitant with beige AT accumulation, producing elevated energy expenditure. In liver, MR upregulated fibroblast growth factor 21 and improved glucose metabolism in aged mice and in response to a high-fat diet. Furthermore, MR also reduces mitochondrial oxidative stress in various organs such as liver, heart, kidneys, and brain. Other effects of MR have also been reported in such areas as cardiac function in response to hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), identification of molecular mechanisms in bone development, and enhanced epithelial tight junction. In addition, rodent models of cancer responded positively to MR, as has been reported in colon, prostate, and breast cancer studies. The beneficial effects of MR have also been documented in a number of invertebrate model organisms, including yeast, nematodes, and fruit flies. MR not only promotes extended longevity in these organisms, but in the case of yeast has also been shown to improve stress tolerance. In addition, expression analyses of yeast and Drosophila undergoing MR have identified multiple candidate mediators of the beneficial effects of MR in these models. In this review, we emphasize other in vivo effects of MR such as in cardiovascular function, bone development, epithelial tight junction, and cancer. We also discuss the effects of MR in invertebrates."

Here, we examine the role of drr-2 and sams-1, two DR-responsive genes recently identified, in determining the longevity of C. elegans.  Inhibition of drr-2 as well as sams-1 has been shown to increase longevity.  Previous studies have also suggested that DR might trigger a regulated reduction in drr-2 and sams-1 expression to initiate its longevity response. However, the molecular mechanisms by which drr-2 or sams-1 influence longevity remain unknown.  While it is known that sams-1 encodes a S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) synthetase that catalyzes the biosynthesis of the universal methyl group donor SAM, the molecular function of drr-2 has not been previously known. We report here that drr-2 encodes an ortholog of human eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4H(eIF4H), whose function is to mediate the initiation step of mRNA translation. By examining the effect of increasing drr-2 expression on DR animals, we find that drr-2 is essential for a large portion of the longevity response to DR. The nutrient sensing target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway has been shown to mediate the longevity effects of DR in C. elegans. Results from our genetic analyses suggest that eIF4H/DRR-2 functions downstream of TOR, but in parallel to the S6K pathway to mediate the lifespan effects of DR. Similarly, we have found that sams-1 may also function downstream of TOR signaling to influence longevity. More interestingly, we found that, in addition to its expression level, the subcellular localization of SAMS-1 is altered in response to TOR signaling and DR. Together, our findings reveal important roles for eIF4H/DRR-2 as well as SAMS-1 in the TOR-mediated longevity responses to DR."

DTT may potentially impact cellular physiology by ER-independent mechanisms; however, such mechanisms remain poorly characterized. Using the nematode model <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, here we show that DTT toxicity is modulated by the bacterial diet. Specifically, the dietary component vitamin B12 alleviates DTT toxicity in a methionine synthase-dependent manner. Using a forward genetic screen, we discover that loss-of-function of R08E5.3, an S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase, confers DTT resistance. DTT upregulates R08E5.3 expression and modulates the activity of the methionine-homocysteine cycle. Employing genetic and biochemical studies, we establish that DTT toxicity is a result of the depletion of SAM. Finally, we show that a functional IRE-1/XBP-1 unfolded protein response pathway is required to counteract toxicity at high, but not low, DTT concentrations."

The gut microbial origin of 2-HIBA was hypothesized, however its actual origin and role in biological processes are still not clear. We investigated how treatment with 2-HIBA affected the physiology of the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, in both standard and high-glucose diet (HGD) growth conditions, by targeted transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) and two-photon fluorescence microscopy. In standard conditions, 2-HIBA resulted particularly effective to extend the lifespan, delay ageing processes and stimulate the oxidative stress resistance in wild type nematodes through the activation of insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) and p38 MAPK pathways and, consequently, through a reduction of ROS levels. Moreover, variations of lipid accumulation observed in treated worms correlated with transcriptional levels of fatty acid synthesis genes and with the involvement of peptide transporter PEP-2. In HGD conditions, the effect of 2-HIBA on C. elegans resulted in a reduction of the lipid droplets deposition, accordingly with an increase of acs-2 gene transcription, involved in &#946;-oxidation processes. In addition, the pro-longevity effect appeared to be correlated to higher levels of tryptophan, which may play a role in restoring the decreased viability observed in the HGD untreated nematodes."

To obtain insight into the physiological importance of lipid droplet size, we isolated and characterized a new S-adenosyl methionine synthetase 1 (SAMS-1)-deficient Caenorhabditis elegans mutant, which have enlarged lipid droplets throughout its life cycle. We found that the sams-1 mutant showed a markedly reduced body size and progeny number; impaired synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, a major membrane phospholipid; and elevated expression of key lipogenic genes, such as dgat-2, resulting in the accumulation of triacylglyceride in fewer, but larger, lipid droplets. The sams-1 mutant store more than 50% (wild type: 10%) of its intestinal fat in large lipid droplets, 10m(3) in size. In response to starvation, SAMS-1 deficiency causes reduced depletion of a subset of lipid droplets located in the anterior intestine. Given the importance of liberation of fatty acids from lipid droplets, we propose that the physiological function of SAMS-1, a highly conserved enzyme involved in one-carbon metabolism, is the limitation of fat storage to ensure proper growth and reproduction."
NA,WBPaper00063813,International Worm Meeting,2021,Identification of Metabolic Pathways Involved in Neuronal Regeneration,"Yadav, Dilip Kumar|Taub, Daniel|Gabel, Christopher","The inability of some neurons to sufficiently regenerate is in part due inefficient activation of intrinsic regeneration programs. A regenerating neuron must molecularly reprogram to allow the production of cellular components and meet the increased energy demands as well. Recent evidence highlights the critical role of metabolism in neuronal regeneration. We recently discovered that modifications in O-linked beta- N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) signaling can strongly enhance axon regeneration. The findings indicate that O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT-1) mutation enhances axon regeneration due to shifts in cellular glycolysis. To identify the important genetic and metabolic factors involved in this effect, we adapted unbiased approach. We performed whole worm RNAseq analysis for wild-type and ogt-1(-/-) or O-GlcNAcase, oga-1(-/-), mutants. A relatively smaller number of genes were differentially expressed in oga-1(-/-) compared to wildtype, but notably they were enriched in carbohydrate, energy, and amino acid metabolism. On the other hand, we identified a large number of differentially expressed genes in the ogt-1(-/-) compared to wild-type. These genes are involved in numerous cellular processes, metabolic and signaling pathways such as development, cell growth and death, and signal transduction, as well as lipid, carbohydrate, amino acid and energy metabolism. Importantly we find differential expression of several genes with known roles in regeneration (including ced-3, daf-18, lin-12, cex-1, fax-1 etc.) confirming the validity of this approach. In addition, we find genes involved in One Carbon Metabolism (OCM), transmethylation pathways (folr-1, sams-5, set-1 etc.) and associated lipid metabolism (fat-7, ckb-2, dod-20 etc.). Performing single neuron regeneration experiments in the major S-Adenosyl Methionine Synthase (sams-1) deletion mutant, we find a significant reduction in regeneration following laser axotomy of the ALM neuron. Importantly sams-1 mutation appears to also block the enhanced regeneration effects of ogt-1 in a sams-1;ogt-1 double mutant. Our findings begin to identify genes and transcriptional regulatory pathways underlying enhanced regeneration via O-GlcNAc signaling. Our results predict that knockdown of OCM or glycolysis genes will either block or reduce, the enhanced regeneration of ogt-1(-/-), highlighting and defining the importance of cellular metabolism in neuronal regeneration."
NA,WBPaper00043211,International Worm Meeting,2013,"Genome wide responses to methyl donor availability reveal effects on metabolic, stress response and germline function genes.","Ding, Wei|Irwin, Michael|Hansen, Malene|Walker, Amy K.","Animals must coordinate nutritional input and metabolism with growth and reproduction. Small molecules, such as s-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) produced by the 1-carbon/folate cycle (1CC) and used as the major methyl donor, can modify protein activity and contribute to phospholipid biosynthesis. In C. elegans, reducing function of sams-1, a SAMe synthase, increases lifespan and lipid droplet accumulation while reducing fertility. We hypothesize that SAMe levels provide signals reseting physiology to compensate for altered nutritional inputs. SAMe is used for methylation of proteins, such as histones in epigenetic modification, but is also critical for production of phosphatidylcholine (PC), a major membrane phospholipid. Indeed sams-1(RNAi) animals have low levels of PC and lipid accumulation, fertility and lifespan return to wild-type levels when methylation-independent pathways of PC production are supported through dietary addition of choline. However, links between SAMe levels and direct changes of gene expression are unknown. To separate SAMe-specific effects from combined SAMe/PC functions, we compared global gene expression levels in sams-1(RNAi) animals with sams-1(RNAi) rescued by choline. Major functional groups of genes increasing with sams-1(RNAi) included metabolism (1CC, lipid biosynthesis, carbohydrate modification) and stress responses. However, decreased genes grouped in distinct subsets of metabolic pathways (carbohydrate catabolism, amino sugar metabolism and lipid binding), as well as genes important for germline function and RNA processing. We found that more than 90% of sams-1(RNAi) up- or downregulated genes returned to wild-type levels with choline supplementation. Interestingly, genes not returning to wild-type levels clustered in metabolic pathways such as the 1CC, suggesting potential for PC-independent SAMe effects. However, essentially all germline function genes were rescued. This correlates with the near complete rescue of fertility by choline, and suggests coordination of brood size with metabolic function acts through SAMe/PC pathways in these animals."

S-adenosylmethionine synthetase (SAMS) produces SAM, an important methyl donor in various phospholipid methyltransferase reactions catalysed by phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PMT-1). A gel-based, quantitative proteomic analysis of the RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated inactivation of the pod-2 gene, which encodes acetyl-CoA carboxylase, showed a substantial down-regulation of SAMS-1. Consequently, RNAi of either sams-1 or pmt-1 caused a significant increase in lipid droplet size in the intestine of Caenorhabditis elegans. Lipid droplets exhibited increased triacylglycerol (TG) and decreased phosphatidylcholine (PC) levels, suggesting a reciprocal relationship between TG and PC regulation. These lipid-associated phenotypes were rescued by choline feeding. Among the five fat metabolism-related genes examined, two genes were highly induced by inactivation of sams-1 or pmt-1: pod-2 and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (fat-7). Thus, both SAMS-1 and PMT-1 were shown to contribute to the homoeostasis of TG and PC levels in C. elegans, which would provide an important survival strategy under harsh environmental conditions."
NA,WBPaper00058577,International Worm Meeting,2019,The subcellular distribution of SAMS-1 is regulated by AMPK and PP2A in response to dietary changes in C. elegans.,"Jung, Y.|Hsu, A.|Ching, T.","Dietary restriction (DR) robustly induces lifespan extension in a variety of species, ranging from yeast to mammals. In our previous studies, we have identified S-adenosylmethionine synthetase 1, SAMS-1, as an important regulator in DR-induced longevity in C. elegans. The subcellular distribution of intestinal SAMS-1 appears to be dynamic and is dependent upon food availability. We found that intestinal SAMS-1 is accumulated in the nucleus under ad libitum condition, whereas SAMS-1 translocates to the cytoplasm in response to starvation or dietary restriction. This DR-induced translocation of SAMS-1 is regulated via its phosphorylation status by AMPK activity. When animals return back to the ad libitum conditions from DR, SAMS-1 is re-localized back to the nucleus as well. Since the subcellular distribution of SAMS-1 is regulated by AMPK, we hypothesized that the translocation of SAMS-1 from the cytosol to the nucleus when recovered from DR is mediated by phosphatases. In order to identify the phosphatases involved in this process, we have performed a phosphatase RNAi screen in C. elegans. Through the screen, we found that RNAi knockdown of protein phosphatase 2A inhibits the relocation of SAMS-1 to the nucleus during the recovery from DR. Our results indicate that AMPK and PP2A might act together to modulate the subcellular distribution of intestinal SAMS-1 in response to dietary changes in C. elegans."

Inactive SREBPs reside cytoplasmically in the ER and are activated by transit to the Golgi, where proteases release transcriptionally active forms to the nucleus. We have found a new set of SBP target genes in the 1-carbon cycle (1CC), including sams-1, an enzyme which produces s-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), the major methyl donor. We also found a feedback loop increasing SBP-1-dependent transcription and lipogenesis in C. elegans, murine liver and human cells when SAMe is limited. Deficiencies folate or other 1C metabolites predispose human fatty liver disease; thus, our studies linking SAMe production to SBP-1-dependent lipogenesis in C. elegans are likely relevant to metabolic disorders common in Western populations. 
   sbp-1(RNAi) animals are lean and several SBP-1 targets, such as fat-7 are also required for lipogenesis. However, sams-1(RNAi) animals have increased lipid accumulation and lipogenic gene expression which depend on sbp-1, suggesting a feedback loop activating SBP-1 when SAMe is limiting. Metabolomic profiling after sams-1 RNAi revealed defects in phosphatidylcholine (PC) biosynthesis, which can require multiple methylation steps. Genetic ablation of PC biosynthesis coupled with dietary rescue experiments show that SBP-1 activity is sensitive to PC levels. We also found that murine liver or human cells with diminished SAMe or PC synthesis had increases in lipogenesis and SREBP-1 activity. Because PC is a major membrane component, we reasoned that SBP-1 activation was mechanistically linked to ER or Golgi function. We found that ER stress responses are strongly activated after sams-1 RNAi, but are not contributors to SBP-1 activation. However, Golgi markers were disrupted. Therefore we examined localization of Golgi-resident, SREBP-activating proteases in human cells and found that limiting SAMe or PC caused these proteases to relocalize to the ER, allowing processing of SREBP-1 and activation. Our observations show SBP-1/SREBP-1 may be over activated when SAMe and PC are low and may also reveal how methyl-deficient diets contribute to human fatty liver disease."

Over the last decade, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has become a popular animal model for exploring the regulation of lipid metabolism, obesity, and obese-related diseases. However, the genomic and functional conservation of lipid metabolism from C. elegans to humans remains unknown. In the present study, we systematically analyzed genes involved in lipid metabolism in the C. elegans genome using comparative genomics. RESULTS: We built a database containing 471 lipid genes from the C. elegans genome, and then assigned most of lipid genes into 16 different lipid metabolic pathways that were integrated into a network. Over 70% of C. elegans lipid genes have human orthologs, with 237 of 471 C. elegans lipid genes being conserved in humans, mice, rats, and Drosophila, of which 71 genes are specifically related to human metabolic diseases. Moreover, RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) was used to disrupt the expression of 356 of 471 lipid genes with available RNAi clones. We found that 21 genes strongly affect fat storage, development, reproduction, and other visible phenotypes, 6 of which have not previously been implicated in the regulation of fat metabolism and other phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first systematic genomic insight into lipid metabolism in C. elegans, supporting the use of C. elegans as an increasingly prominent model in the study of metabolic diseases."

In Caenorhabditis elegans, the Mediator subunit mdt-15 is essential for the expression of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism and ingestion-associated stress responses. mdt-15 loss of function causes defects in reproduction and mobility and shortens lifespan. In the present study, we find that worms with mutated or depleted mdt-15 (mdt-15 worms) exhibit decreased membrane phospholipid desaturation, especially in phosphatidylcholine. Accordingly, mdt-15 worms exhibit disturbed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis, as indicated by a constitutively activated ER unfolded protein response (UPR(ER)). Activation of this stress response is only partially the consequence of reduced membrane lipid desaturation, implicating other mdt-15-regulated processes in maintaining ER homeostasis. Interestingly, mdt-15 inactivation or depletion of the lipid metabolism enzymes stearoyl-CoA-desaturases (SCD) and S-adenosyl methionine synthetase (sams-1) activates the UPR(ER) without promoting misfolded protein aggregates. Moreover, these worms exhibit wild-type sensitivity to chemically induced protein misfolding, and they do not display synthetic lethality with mutations in UPR(ER) genes, which cause protein misfolding. Therefore, the constitutively activated UPR(ER) in mdt-15, SCD, and sams-1 worms is not the consequence of proteotoxic stress but likely is the direct result of changes in ER membrane fluidity and composition. Together, our data suggest that the UPR(ER) is induced directly upon membrane disequilibrium and thus monitors altered ER homeostasis."
