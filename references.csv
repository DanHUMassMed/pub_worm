"Nephronophthisis (NPH) is a cystic kidney disorder that causes end-stage renal failure in children. Five nephrocystin (nephrocystin-1 to nephrocystin-5) genes, whose function is disrupted in NPH patients, have been identified and data indicate they form a complex at cell junctions and focal adhesions. More recently, the nephrocystin proteins have also been identified in cilia, as have multiple other cystic kidney disease related proteins. Significant insights into this cilia and cystic kidney disease connection have come from analyses in simpler eukaryotic organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans. In this regard, we became interested in the C. elegans homologs of nephrocystin-1 (nph-1) and nephrocystin-4 (nph-4) from a database screen to identify genes coordinately regulated by the ciliogenic transcription factor DAF-19. Here we show that expression of nph-1 and nph-4 is DAF-19 dependent, that their expression is restricted to ciliated sensory neurons, and that both NPH-1 and NPH-4 concentrate at the transition zones at the base of the cilia, but are not found in the cilium axoneme. In addition, NPH-4 is required for the localization of NPH-1 to this domain. Interestingly, nph-1 or nph-4 mutants have no obvious cilia assembly defects; however, they do have abnormalities in cilia-mediated sensory functions as evidenced by abnormal chemotaxis and lifespan regulation. Our data suggest that rather than having a ciliogenic role, the NPH proteins play an important function as part of the sensory or signaling machinery of this organelle. These findings suggest that the defects in human NPH patients may not be the result of aberrant ciliogenesis but abnormal cilia-sensory functions.",WBPaper00027772,The C. elegans homologs of nephrocystin-1 and nephrocystin-4 are cilia transition zone proteins involved in chemosensory perception.,J Cell Sci,2005,Winkelbauer ME|Schafer JC|Haycraft CJ|Swoboda P|Yoder BK
"Cilia are an important cellular differentiation of sensory neurons for receiving information from the environment. For example in C. elegans, ciliated sensory neurons in the amphid sensilla mediate responses to environmental conditions. Mutations that affect the morphology of ciliated endings of these sensory neurons usually cause diverse phenotypes such as defective chemo- and mechanosensation. They also affect the decision of whether or not to form a dauer (diapause) larva. These mutations identify genes required for proper neuronal differentiation and cilia formation. daf-19 mutants (daf = dauer formation affected) completely lack sensory cilia. This was shown by electron microscopy (serial sections through the head of the worm) and by analysis of transgenic animals expressing GFP in the amphid neuron ASE in daf-19 mutants. Aside from the absence of cilia, the neurons seemed to be morphologically normal. The amphid neuron AFD (which has only a rudimentary cilium) was apparently normal in daf-19 mutants. We cloned daf-19. It encodes an RFX-type transcription factor. So far this class of proteins has been found in humans, mice and yeast. From work with mammalian cell cultures the RFX-binding sites (X-boxes) for some members of the family are known. By searching the C. elegans genome database we found DNA-sequences that fit the X-box consensus in the promoter regions of genes known to be expressed or to function in ciliated sensory neurons. As a first step toward testing whether daf-19 transcriptionally regulates these genes in vivo we fused three different promoters to GFP (che-2, osm-1, osm-6; containing either wild-type or mutated X-box sequences, respectively). In the wild-type situation all three promoters drove GFP expression in ciliated sensory neurons in the head and in the tail of the animal. When the X-box sequences were mutated in all three promoters, GFP expression was drastically curtailed or absent in all of these neurons. So far our results strongly suggest that DAF-19 controls the transcription of a battery of genes whose products form the sensory cilium or function therein.",WBPaper00017404,daf-19 REGULATES THE FORMATION OF CILIATED ENDINGS OF SENSORY NEURONS IN C.

"RFX transcription factors are master regulators of ciliogenesis in diverse animal species. The sole Caenorhabditis elegans RFX homolog, DAF-19, plays at least two roles in the formation of functional cilia. The DAF-19(C) isoform is required for ciliogenesis and the DAF-19(M) isoform is required for the functional specialization of a subset of male-specific ciliated neurons called PKD neurons. Here we report the identification of a novel mutation, daf-19(sm129), which disrupts the functional specification of PKD neurons and thus suggests that daf-19m activity is compromised. However, ciliogenesis is not disrupted in daf-19(sm129) mutants suggesting that daf-19c activity is retained. The sm129 mutation disrupts a splice acceptor site adjacent to an exon common to the daf-19c and daf-19m isoforms resulting in aberrant splicing in a proportion of transcripts. While aberrant splicing of daf-19c to upstream cryptic sites results in in-frame and functional products, a large proportion of daf-19m mRNAs include the entire upstream intron, which introduces a frameshift and stop codons. At least 15% of disease-causing mutations affect splicing of the gene bearing the mutation, thus it is important to understand the consequences of splice site mutations on gene function. However, predicting the effects of a splice site mutation remains difficult and experimental determination is still required. Using daf-19(sm129) as a model, our results suggest that this problem is exacerbated when a splice acceptor mutation is used by multiple isoforms of the same gene because the effects on each isoform can be dramatically different.",WBPaper00046396,A splice acceptor mutation in C. elegans daf-19/Rfx disrupts functional specialization of male-specific ciliated neurons but does not affect ciliogenesis.,Gene,2015,Wells KL|Rowneki M|Killian DJ
"Cilia are an important cellular differentiation of sensory neurons for receiving information from the environment. 60 of the 302 C. elegans neurons have ciliated endings. Mutations in a large number of genes have been identified that affect the structure of these sensory cilia. Of these, daf-19 mutations are unique in completely lacking all sensory cilia. This was shown by electron microscopy and by analysis of transgenic animals expressing GFP in different sensory neurons. Aside from the absence of sensory cilia, the neurons seem to be morphologically normal. We previously reported that daf-19 encodes an RFX-type transcription factor. This class of proteins has been found in humans, mice and yeast. From work with mammalian cell cultures the RFX-binding sites (x-boxes; 14-16 bp long) for some members of the family are known. We found x-box-like sequences in the promoter regions of genes known to be expressed or to function in ciliated sensory neurons. As of now we have tested whether daf-19 transcriptionally regulates three of these genes in vivo by fusing their promoters to GFP ( che-2 , osm-1 , osm-6 ; containing either wild-type or mutated x-box sequences, respectively). We found that these promoters drove GFP expression only in ciliated sensory neurons and that expression was dependent on daf-19 function and on the x-box sequence. Using these C. elegans x-box sequences as a guide, we searched the C. elegans genome database and identified 20-30 additional x-boxes which, by sequence similarity and position within the promoter region, define new genes that are potential daf-19 regulatory targets. Our results strongly suggest that DAF-19 regulates the differentiation of sensory cilia by activating the transcription of a battery of genes whose products form the sensory cilium.",WBPaper00023019,Genes involved in the formation of ciliated endings of sensory neurons in C. elegans,International C. elegans Meeting,1999,P Swoboda|JH Thomas
"We have been working on the control of the periodic activation of the defecation motor program. What factors determine that the defecation motor program is activated every 45 sec in well-fed adult worms? In part we have taken a genetic approach to answering this question. We have outlined our screen for defecation cycle period mutants (Dec) in recent C. elegans meeting abstracts. The mutants we have identified so far fall into several classes; Dec-s (short) mutants that activate the motor program faster than every 45 sec, Dec-l (long) mutants that have much longer intervals between defecations, Dec-v (variable) mutants that have cycle periods that vary, and finally the Dec-echo mutant which I will discuss in detail. The"" Echo"" phenotype was originally described for the strain DR86 carrying daf-19 (m86)II, as an additional posterior body contraction following the normal motor program with a delay of about 10 seconds (Thomas, Genetics, 1990). We have recently determined that the echo phenotype does not map to the daf-19 locus but to an independent location in the unc-22 cluster of IV. We have designated this Echo allele sa200 .sa200 is completely recessive and it's phenotype is similar in trans to a deficiency of the locus, indicating that Echo may be the null phenotype. Wild-type worms on plentiful food activate the motor program about every 45 sec with a standard deviation of less than 3 sec, as shown in the left panel of the figure. In the figure the occurrence of the motor program is indicated by the letters p, a, and x for each of the three steps of the complete motor program, posterior body contraction, anterior body contraction, and expulsion. Each part of the motor program is usually but not necessarily activated for each defecation. Each dot represents one second of elapsed time. The right panel shows the defecation phenotype of the mutant JT200 (sa200 ).Following the normal motor program is a weaker and more variable version of the motor program that we have termed the Echo. The Echo cycle follows the principal cycle with a latency of 10-15 sec. The Echo cycle is much more likely to be missing a part of the motor program and the contraction of the muscles appears weaker. [See Figure 1] JT200 animals also have an unusual phenotype in the absence of food. In the absence of food wild-type animals stop pumping their pharynx and cease defecating. After more than one hour off of food animals resume sporadic pumping of their pharynx but defecate very infrequently, on average less than once every 400s (n = 19 animals). In contrast after about 20 minutes off of food, JT200 animals resume defecating. The average cycle period is 145s (n=19 animals) and appears less periodic, but defecation is occurring much more frequently than in wild-type animals. Additionally, echos are seldom observed when JT200 activates the motor program off of food (see below). We wondered whether food concentration affected the 10-15s delay between the principal cycle and the echo, or whether food concentration determined how often an echo occurred. We made a concentrated suspension of OP50 (A=.60 at OD600 ),which, when spread on agar plates had the consistency of a mature bacterial lawn. This was designated a 1x food preparation. We tested echo and N2 animals on 1 x food to confirm that cycle periodicity was the same as on normally grown food. We then tested animal's defecation behavior on dilutions of the 1x food stock. Based on the data in the Table, we conclude that the probability of an echo occurring is influenced by the food concentration while the delay from principal cycle is not.

"Ciliated neurons in animals are important for the reception of environmental stimuli. To understand the mechanism of cilium morphogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans, we analyzed dyf-3 mutants that are defective in uptake of a fluorescent dye and abnormal in sensory cilium structure. Expression of green fluorescent protein in sensory neurons of a dyf-3 mutant revealed that the mutant has stunted cilia and abnormal posterior projections in some sensory neurons. The dyf-3 gene encodes three proteins with different N-terminals. The largest DYF-3 protein has 404 amino acid residues that are 38% identical with those of a predicted human protein of unknown function. Expression of a functional dyf-3Colon, two colonsgfp fusion gene is detected in 26 chemosensory neurons, including six IL2 neurons, eight pairs of amphid neurons (ASE, ADF, ASG, ASH, ASI, ASJ, ASK and ADL) and two pairs of phasmid neurons (PHA and PHB). Expression of a dyf-3 cDNA in specific neurons of dyf-3 animals indicated that dyf-3 acts cell-autonomously for fluorescent dye uptake. Reduction of dyf-3Colon, two colonsgfp expression in a daf-19 mutant suggests that dyf-3 expression is regulated by DAF-19 transcription factor, and DYF-3 may be involved in the intraflagellar transport system.",WBPaper00024960,The dyf-3 gene encodes a novel protein required for sensory cilium formation in Caenorhabditis elegans.,J Mol Biol,2005,Murayama T|Toh Y|Ohshima Y|Koga M
"Our lab is interested in the regulation of neurotransmitter biosynthesis under aversive conditions. Using GFP reporters, we found that the expression of GABA synthesis gene unc-25/glutamic acid decarboxylase was increased, while acetylcholine (ACh) synthesis gene cha-1/choline acetyltransferase was reduced in dauer animals. By contrast, we observed that in starved L1 animals, the expression of both unc-25::gfp and cha-1::gfp was decreased, suggesting that GABA biosynthesis is differentially regulated under distinct aversive conditions. A previous report indicated that the RFX transcription factor DAF-19 is expressed in the locomotory neurons and daf-19 mutants exhibited enhanced resistance to aldicarb (Senti and Swoboda, 2008). We found that daf-19::gfp levels in the locomotory neurons was reduced in wild-type dauers. Since either reduced ACh neurotransmission or increased GABA neurotransmission could lead to enhanced resistance to aldicarb (Loria et al., 2004; Vashlishan et al., 2008), we analyzed unc-25::gfp and cha-1::gfp in daf-19 mutants. We observed that cha-1::gfp was reduced in daf-19 mutants. Furthermore, we found that the expression of unc-25 and unc-47/vesicular GABA transporter was significantly increased in both daf-19(m86) and daf-19(yz70) mutants. While several previous studies have shown that DAF-19 acts as a transcriptional activator (Swoboda et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2010; Xie et al., 2013), our results suggest that DAF-19 may also act as a negative regulator of GABA neurotransmission under optimal growth conditions. Enhanced GABA neurotransmission could represent a genetic program that inhibit un-necessary locomotion under aversive growth conditions and may contribute to the characteristic relax appearance of dauers.

"The daf-19 gene encodes the only RFX transcription factor in C. elegans, producing at least four related protein isoforms, one of which, DAF-19C, is responsible for ciliogenesis. Previous work by Senti and Swoboda (Mol Biol Cell 2008) demonstrated that adult worms deficient in all four DAF-19 proteins have extremely aberrant dwelling and roaming behavior on food.  Most intriguing is that transgenic addition of the DAF-19C isoform restored cilia formation, but did not fully restore dwelling and roaming behavioral defects.  We are developing a related assay that mimics a patchy food environment to further probe worm foraging behavior.  We are testing worms lacking all isoforms of DAF-19 as well as those containing mutant alleles that affect only the larger isoforms of DAF-19 to determine whether these isoforms play a role in nervous system function.",WBPaper00047878,Assessment of DAF-19-Related Behavioral Defects.,International Worm Meeting,2015,"Stinson, Loraina|Piasecki, Brian P.|Sugiaman-Trapman, Debora|Swoboda, Peter"
"The C. elegans gene Y41G9a.1 encodes the homologue of the mouse gene Tg737 which was identified through a BLAST search of the C. elegans genome database. Y41G9a.1 (CeTg737) was isolated from a mixed stage C. elegans cDNA library. CeTg737 encodes a predicted 823 amino acid protein with 45% identity to the mouse protein (Polaris). As determined for Polaris, CeTg737 contains two blocks of tetratricopeptide motifs (TPR) thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions. Northern blot analysis reveals a 2.6 kb transcript with the highest level of expression during embryogenesis and early larval stages. Transcriptional Y41G9a.1::GFP fusions using 400 bp upstream of the predicted ATG show expression in ciliated neurons including the amphids and phasmids. Analysis of the promoter region identified a potential X-box sequence approximately 100 bp upstream of the ATG. X-boxes are targets for the DAF-19 transcription factor and have been identified in the promoters of several genes involved in sensory cilia formation or maintenance. The role of DAF-19 in regulation of CeTg737 is currently being explored. Consistent with GFP expression analysis, monoclonal antibodies raised against recombinant CeTg737 detect a protein in the dendrites and cilia of sensory neurons and the sensory rays of the male tail. Overall the results in the worm are in agreement with our analysis in the mouse where Polaris localizes to the base of cilia and its disruption results in a loss of cilia.",WBPaper00016922,"Y41G9a.1, the C. elegans Homologue of Tg737, is Expressed in Ciliated Neurons",West Coast Worm Meeting,2000,Yoder BK|Taulman PD|Krum SM|Haycraft CJ
"Sensory perception and metabolic homeostasis are known to deteriorate with ageing, impairing the health of aged animals, while mechanisms underlying their deterioration remain poorly understood. The potential interplay between the declining sensory perception and the impaired metabolism during ageing is also barely explored. Here, we report that the intraflagellar transport (IFT) in the cilia of sensory neurons is impaired in the aged nematode Caenorhabditis elegans due to a daf-19/RFX-modulated decrease of IFT components. We find that the reduced IFT in sensory cilia thus impairs sensory perception with ageing. Moreover, we demonstrate that whereas the IFT-dependent decrease of sensory perception in aged worms has a mild impact on the insulin/IGF-1 signalling, it remarkably suppresses AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signalling across tissues. We show that upregulating daf-19/RFX effectively enhances IFT, sensory perception, AMPK activity and autophagy, promoting metabolic homeostasis and longevity. Our study determines an ageing pathway causing IFT decay and sensory perception deterioration, which in turn disrupts metabolism and healthy ageing.",WBPaper00061202,The decrease of intraflagellar transport impairs sensory perception and metabolism in ageing.,Nat Commun,2021,Zhang Y|Zhang X|Dai Y|Song M|Zhou Y|Zhou J|Yan X|Shen Y
"RAB, ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) and ARF-like (ARL) proteins belong to the Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins and are essential for various membrane-associated intracellular trafficking processes. None of the approximately 50 known members of this family are linked to human disease. Using a bioinformatic screen for ciliary genes in combination with mutational analyses, we identified ARL6 as the gene underlying Bardet-Biedl syndrome type 3, a multisystemic disorder characterized by obesity, blindness, polydactyly, renal abnormalities and cognitive impairment. We uncovered four different homozygous substitutions in ARL6 in four unrelated families affected with Bardet-Biedl syndrome, two of which disrupt a threonine residue important for GTP binding and function of several related small GTP-binding proteins. Analysis of the Caenorhabditis elegans ARL6 homolog indicates that it is specifically expressed in ciliated cells, and that, in addition to the postulated cytoplasmic functions of ARL proteins, it undergoes intraflagellar transport. These findings implicate a small GTP-binding protein in ciliary transport and the pathogenesis of a pleiotropic disorder.",WBPaper00024444,Mutations in a member of the Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins causes Bardet-Biedl syndrome.,Nat Genet,2004,Fan Y|Esmail MA|Ansley SJ|Blacque OE|Boroevich K|Ross AJ|Moore SJ|Badano JL|May-Simera H|Compton DS|Green JS|Lewis RA|Van Haelst MM|Parfrey PS|Baillie DL|Beales PL|Katsanis N|Davidson WS|Leroux MR
"Studying the development and mechanisms of sensory perception is challenging in organisms with complex neuronal networks. The worm Caenorhabditis elegans possesses a simple neuronal network of 302 neurons that includes 60 ciliated sensory neurons (CSNs) for detecting external sensory input. C. elegans is thus an excellent model in which to study sensory neuron development, function, and behavior. We have generated a genetic rescue system that allows in vivo analyses of isolated CSNs at both cellular and systemic levels. We used the RFX transcription factor DAF-19, a key regulator of ciliogenesis. Mutations in daf-19 result in the complete absence of all sensory cilia and thus of external sensory input. In daf-19 mutants, we used cell-specific rescue of DAF-19 function in selected neurons, thereby generating animals with single, fully functional CSNs. Otherwise and elsewhere these animals are completely devoid of any environmental input through cilia. We demonstrated the rescue of fully functional, single cilia using fluorescent markers, sensory behavioral assays, and calcium imaging. Our technique, functional rescue in single sensory cilia (FRISSC), can thus cell-autonomously and cell-specifically restore the function of single sensory neurons and their ability to respond to sensory input. FRISSC can be adapted to many different CSNs and thus constitutes an excellent tool for studying sensory behaviors, both in single animals and in populations of worms. FRISSC will be very useful for the molecular dissection of sensory perception in CSNs and for the analysis of the developmental aspects of ciliogenesis.",WBPaper00035071,Worms with a single functional sensory cilium generate proper neuron-specific behavioral output.,Genetics,2009,Senti G|Ezcurra M|Lobner J|Schafer WR|Swoboda P
"Monitoring Editor: Erika Holzbaur The intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery required to build functional cilia consists of a multisubunit complex whose molecular composition, organization and function is poorly understood. Here, we describe a novel WD repeat (WDR) containing IFT protein from C. elegans, DYF-2, that plays a critical role in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the IFT machinery. We determined the identity of the dyf-2 gene by transgenic rescue of mutant phenotypes and by sequencing of mutant alleles. Loss of DYF-2 function selectively affects the assembly and motility of different IFT components and leads to defects in cilia structure and chemosensation in the nematode. Based on these observations, and the analysis of DYF-2 movement in a Bardet-Biedl syndrome mutant with partially disrupted IFT particles, we conclude that DYF-2 can associate with IFT particle complex B. At the same time, mutations in dyf-2 can interfere with the function of complex A components, suggesting an important role of this protein in the assembly of the IFT particle as a whole. Importantly, the mouse ortholog of DYF-2, WDR19, also localizes to cilia, pointing to an important evolutionarily conserved role for this WDR protein in cilia development and function.",WBPaper00028470,"Caenorhabditis elegans DYF-2, an orthologue of human WDR19, is a component of the intraflagellar transport machinery in sensory cilia.",Mol Biol Cell,2006,Efimenko E|Blacque OE|Ou G|Haycraft CJ|Yoder BK|Scholey JM|Leroux MR|Swoboda P
"Mutations affecting dauer larva formation result in one of two phenotypes: dauer defective (Daf-d) or dauer constitutive (Daf-c). Daf-d mutants do not form dauers under dauer-inducing conditions, whereas Daf-c mutants form dauers under non-inducing conditions. Ciliated sensory neurons in the amphids mediate the response to these environmental conditions. Mutations that affect the morphology of these ciliated sensory endings are usually Daf-d. daf-19 mutants are the exception: they completely lack ciliated endings and are Daf-c. All three alleles of daf-19 (m86, sa190, sa232) are strongly Daf-c: ca. 70% or more dauer larvae at 15 C, ca. 95% or more at 25 C (dauer formation is an inherently temperature sensitive process). The unusual combination of phenotypes could be due to a cell fate specification defect during amphid neuron development. Killing the amphid neurons ADF, ASI and ASG causes a Daf-c phenotype, suggesting that impaired development of amphid neurons can trigger dauer formation. By analysis of daf-d; daf-19 double mutants, we have positioned daf-19 in the formal genetic pathway for dauer formation. daf-19 is epistatic to Daf-d mutations in both parallel branches of this pathway and lies upstream of the Daf-d gene daf-12. The genes in the parallel branches are thought to be important for sensory response leading to dauer formation, whereas the genes downsteam and including daf-12 are thought to be important for the reception of amphid neuronal signals by target tissues and for the activation of dauer larva morphogenesis. A possible interpretation of epistasis analyses is that daf-19 affects a basic function of the amphid neurons involved leading to a Daf-c sensory response. Germline transformation rescue experiments demonstrated that two overlapping cosmid clones, ZK945 and F27E5, individually rescue daf-19 phenotypes. Subsequent rescue by various subclones from the 9 kbp overlap region revealed that daf-19 is the same as the gene F27E5.5 (predicted by the C. elegans genome project). Database searches and comparisons showed that this gene encodes a novel protein with several putative transmembrane domains and weak similarity to human melanocortin peptide hormone receptors. Melanocortins have diverse functions, including regulating nerve cell growth during development and regeneration after damage. Taken together the results suggest that daf-19 might encode a protein involved in cell specification or morphogenesis of amphid sensory neurons. Mutations in daf-19 may thus interfere with the normal dauer formation signalling by causing misspecification of neurons.",WBPaper00017206,daf-19 CONTROLS SENSORY NEURON DEVELOPMENT IN C.

"DAF-19, the only RFX transcription factor found in C. elegans, is required for the formation of neuronal sensory cilia. Four isoforms of the DAF-19 protein have been reported, and the daf-19(m86) nonsense mutation affecting all four isoforms has been shown to prevent cilia formation. Transcriptome analyses employing microarrays of L1 or adult stage worms were completed using RNA from daf-19(m86) worms and an isogenic wild type strain to identify potential additional DAF-19 target genes. Using transcriptional fusions with GFP, we compared the expression patterns of several potential target genes using fluorescence confocal microscopy.  Our data indicate that at least three new genes are activated by DAF-19 in both ciliated and non-ciliated sensory neurons.  One gene is activated in IL2 neurons, a class of ciliated sensory neurons while two genes are activated by DAF-19 in the URX neuron.  URX is through to be important for aerotaxis, lifespan regulation, and suppression of innate immunity. These results suggest a role for DAF-19 beyond that of ciliogenesis.

"We describe here the functional analysis of the C. elegans LIM homeobox gene lim-6, the ortholog of the mammalian Lmx-1a and b genes that regulate limb, CNS, kidney and eye development. lim-6 is expressed in a small number of sensory-, inter- and motorneurons, in epithelial cells of the uterus and in the excretory system. Loss of lim-6 function affects late events in the differentiation of two classes of GABAergic motorneurons which control rhythmic enteric muscle contraction. lim-6 is required to specify the correct axon morphology of these neurons and also regulates expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase, the rate limiting enzyme of GABA synthesis in these neurons. Moreover, lim-6 gene activity and GABA signaling regulate neuroendocrine outputs of the nervous system. In the chemosensory system lim-6 regulates the asymmetric expression of a probable chemosensory receptor. lim-6 is also required in epithelial cells for uterine morphogenesis. We compare the function of lim-6 to those of other LIM homeobox genes in C. elegans and suggest that LIM homeobox genes share the common theme of controlling terminal neural differentiation steps that when disrupted lead to specific neuroanatomical and neural function defects.",WBPaper00003509,The Caenorhabditis elegans lim-6 LIM homeobox gene regulates neurite outgrowth and function of particular GABAergic neurons.,Development,1999,Hobert O|Tessmar K|Ruvkun GB
"Regulatory Factor X transcription factors (RFX TFs) are best known for activating genes required for ciliogenesis in both vertebrates and invertebrates. In humans, eight RFX TFs have a variety of tissue-specific functions, while in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the sole RFX gene, daf-19, encodes a set of nested isoforms. Null alleles of daf-19 confer pleiotropic effects including altered development with a dauer constitutive phenotype, complete absence of cilia and ciliary proteins, and defects in synaptic protein maintenance. We sought to identify RFX/daf-19 target genes associated with neuronal functions other than ciliogenesis using comparative transcriptome analyses at different life stages of the worm. Subsequent characterization of gene expression patterns revealed one set of genes activated in the presence of DAF-19 in ciliated sensory neurons and whose activation requires the daf-19c isoform, also required for ciliogenesis. A second set of genes is down-regulated in the presence of DAF-19, primarily in non-sensory neurons. The human orthologs of some of these neuronal genes are associated with human diseases. We report the novel finding that daf-19a is directly or indirectly responsible for down-regulation of these neuronal genes in C. elegans by characterizing a new mutation affecting the daf-19a isoform (tm5562) and not associated with ciliogenesis, but which confers synaptic and behavioral defects. We have thus identified a new regulatory role for RFX TFs in the nervous system.

"Cilia are conserved cellular structures that facilitate sensory-based processes, including those required for neuronal and kidney functions. Here, we show that the human mitogen activated kinase-15 (MAPK-15) ortholog in Caenorhabditis elegans encodes a ciliary protein. A strain harboring a mutation in the catalytic site of the kinase domain results in ciliary-specific defects in tail neurons of both hermaphrodite and male worms, manifesting in dye uptake, dendrite extension, and male mating behavior defects. Transgenic-fusion constructs for two mapk-15 isoforms (A and C) with full-length kinase domains were generated. Expression of either the A- or C-specific isoform rescues the dye-filling and male-mating defective phenotypes, confirming the ciliary function of mapk-15. Expression of mapk-15 occurs in many ciliated-sensory neurons of the head and tail in hermaphrodite and male worms. Localization of MAPK-15 isoforms A and C occurs in the cell body, dendritic processes, and cilia. A C. elegans ortholog of polycystin-2, a protein that when defective in mammals results in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, is mislocalized in the male ray neurons of mapk-15 mutant worms. Expression of the mapk-15 gene by the pkd-2 promoter partially rescues the male-mating defects observed in mapk-15 mutant animals. Expression of mapk-15 is DAF-19/RFX dependent in some CSNs and DAF-19/RFX independent in others. Collectively, these data suggest that MAPK-15 functions upstream of PKD-2 localization to modulate ciliary sensory functions.",WBPaper00051560,MAPK-15 is a ciliary protein required for PKD-2 localization and male mating behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans.,Cytoskeleton (Hoboken),2017,Piasecki BP|Sasani TA|Lessenger AT|Huth N|Farrell S
"A degenerative disease-like phenotype, specifically reduction in synaptic protein levels in adult worms, is correlated with loss-of-function of the only RFX transcription factor gene, daf-19, in C. elegans. This gene encodes four known transcription factor isoforms, two of which are correlated with particular functions. The DAF-19C isoform activates genes responsible for cilia development, while DAF-19M is needed for cilia specification in males. A comparison of the transcriptome of daf-19 null and isogenic wild type adult worms suggests both positive and negative regulation of gene expression is correlated with the presence of DAF-19 proteins. We have assessed DAF-19 regulation of gene expression using transcriptional fusion constructs of putative target genes in daf-19 wild type and mutant worms. We have found that at least three genes are repressed by the DAF-19 transcription factor in particular nerve cells. In one case, differential gene expression is seen in sensory neurons while differential expression of two other genes is limited to interneurons. Interestingly, none of these genes have been shown to contain an X-box, the cis-acting sequence used to activate genes involved in cilia formation. These data suggest that DAF-19 has an additional role beyond that of sensory neuron development and specification. Because the daf-19 gene produces at least four related proteins, further experimentation is required to determine which DAF-19 isoform(s) are responsible for repression of gene expression. We are currently using new alleles of daf-19 to whether the largest DAF-19 proteins, DAF-19A/B have a role in repressing target gene expression.",WBPaper00047993,"Repression of Neuronal Gene Expression by the RFX Transcription Factor, DAF-19.",International Worm Meeting,2015,"Ek-Vazquez, Zabdiel|Vogel, Savannah|Hurlburt, Alex|Sugiaman-Trapman, Debora|Swoboda, Peter|De Stasio, Elizabeth A."
"BACKGROUND: C. elegans is an important model for genetic studies relevant to human biology and disease. We sought to assess the orthology between C. elegans and human genes to understand better the relationship between their genomes and to generate a compelling list of candidates to streamline RNAi-based screens in this model. RESULTS: We performed a meta-analysis of results from four orthology prediction programs and generated a compendium, ""OrthoList"", containing 7,663 C. elegans protein-coding genes. Various assessments indicate that OrthoList has extensive coverage with low false-positive and false-negative rates. Part of this evaluation examined the conservation of components of the receptor tyrosine kinase, Notch, Wnt, TGF-B and insulin signaling pathways, and led us to update compendia of conserved C. elegans kinases, nuclear hormone receptors, F-box proteins, and transcription factors. Comparison with two published genome-wide RNAi screens indicated that virtually all of the conserved hits would have been obtained had just the OrthoList set (38% of the genome) been targeted. We compiled Ortholist by InterPro domains and Gene Ontology annotation, making it easy to identify C. elegans orthologs of human disease genes for potential functional analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We anticipate that OrthoList will be of considerable utility to C. elegans researchers for streamlining RNAi screens, by focusing on genes with apparent human orthologs, thus reducing screening effort by 60%. Moreover, we find that OrthoList provides a useful basis for annotating orthology and reveals more C. elegans orthologs of human genes in various functional groups, such as transcription factors, than previously described.",WBPaper00038491,OrthoList: a compendium of C. elegans genes with human orthologs.,PLoS One,2011,Shaye DD|Greenwald I
"The regulation of transcription in C. elegans shares many similarities to transcription in other organisms. The details of how specific transcription factors bind to target promoters and act as either activators or repressors are still being examined in many cases, but an increasing number of factors and their binding sites are being characterized. This chapter reviews the general concepts that have emerged with regards to promoter function in C. elegans. Included are the methods that have been successfully employed as well as limitations encountered to date. Specific cis-acting promoter elements from myo-2 , hlh-1 and lin-26 are discussed as examples of complex promoters regulated by multiple sequence elements. In addition, examples of organ-, tissue-, and cell type-specific mechanisms for generating spatial specificity in gene expression are discussed.",WBPaper00027309,Transcriptional regulation.,WormBook,2005,Peter G.

"We have been trying to clone age-1 gene. age-1 was mapped to the left of unc-4 on chromosome II. The predicted genetic distance between age-1 and daf-23 is about 2 c.m. Recently, it has been proposed that age-1 and daf-23 may be allelic, because they do not complement for the Daf-c phenotype at 27oC (Inoue, T. and Thomas, J., 10th international C.elegans meeting). To test this possibility, we performed genetical mapping between age-1 and daf-23 by taking advantage of the Daf-c phenotype. We crossed TJ1052 [age-1(hx546)] males and daf-23 homozygotes from DR846 {unc-4(e120); daf-23(m333)/mnC1[dpy-10(e128); unc-52(e444)] }(DR846 is from Don Riddle). The cross produced two F2 recombinants out of 1,261 tested. The genotype of these recombinants indicates that the genetical distance between age-1 and daf-23 is 0.3 c.m. This result is consistent with the data that the Daf-c phenotype ofage-1 maps between bli-1 and rol-1 (Thomas, J., personal communication). This suggests two possibilities: 1) age-1 and daf-23 are allelic and 0.3 c.m. reflects intragenic recombination, or 2) age-1 and daf-23 are not allelic but genetically close to each other. More precise mapping, such as physical mapping of the two genes, would be necessary to test these possibilities. Since partial non-complementation between different genes has been observed in yeast (e.g., Murakami, S. and Niwa, O., in press), it might be possible that mutations in different genes fail to complement. We have also tried to map age-1 by using chromosome deficiencies (Dfs). Interestingly, many, but not all, strains carrying deficiencies around unc-4 or sqt-1 (close to daf-23) produce dauers at 27oC. This finding suggests that they are haplo-insufficient. Although these Dfs are not very useful for mapping the Daf-c phenotype of age-1, they may be a good tool for mapping new Daf-c mutations. A single copy of one or more genes in these deficiency regions causes dauer formation at this temperature. We are now mapping these Daf-c responsible regions. Preliminary results suggest three possible regions: to the left of unc-4, to the right of unc-4 (this does not include daf-19), and at daf-23.",WBPaper00015132,MAPPING OF AGE-1 and DAF-23.,Worm Breeder's Gazette,1995,Murakami S|Tedesco PM|Lithgow GJ|Huchinson EW|Johnson TE
"Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is caused by a group of variably inherited human disorders that are major causes of end-stage renal disease in both children and adults. The genetic culprits responsible for autosomal-dominant PKD (ADPKD), the polycystins, have been identified, yet still little is known about the molecular mechanisms that result in the disease phenotype. Polycystin homologs have been isolated in the model genetic organism Caenorhabditis elegans and, interestingly, play a specific role in C. elegans male mating behavior. Despite the recruitment of the polycystins for divergent functions in worms and humans it appears that the fundamental molecular and genetic interactions of these genes are evolutionarily conserved. In addition, studies in the worm have contributed to an understanding of the emerging role for cilia in the function of the polycystin pathway, expanding a promising frontier in PKD research. C. elegans has also been used to identify a gene family which may have significance for understanding the formation and maintenance of renal tubules.",WBPaper00025249,Mating worms and the cystic kidney: Caenorhabditis elegans as a model for renal disease.,Pediatr Nephrol,2005,Lipton J
"Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a genetic disorder that affects primary cilia. BBSome, a protein complex composed of eight BBS proteins, regulates the structure and function of cilia, and its malfunction causes BBS in humans. Here, we report a cilia-independent function of BBSome. To identify genes that regulate the C.elegans photoreceptor protein LITE-1 in ciliated ASH photosensory neurons, we performed a genetic screen and isolated bbs mutants. Functional analysis revealed that BBSome regulates LITE-1 protein stability independently of cilia. Through another round of genetic screening, we found that this cilia-independent function of BBSome is mediated by DLK-MAPK signaling, which acts downstream of BBSome to control LITE-1 stability via Rab5-mediated endocytosis. BBSome exerts its function by regulating the expression of DLK. BBSome also regulates the expression of LZK, a mammalian DLK in human cells. These studies identify a cilia-independent function of BBSome and uncover DLK as an evolutionarily conserved BBSome effector.",WBPaper00064108,A cilia-independent function of BBSome mediated by DLK-MAPK signaling in C.elegans photosensation.,Dev Cell,2022,Zhang X|Liu J|Pan T|Ward A|Xu XZS
"The successful development of every organism depends on the correct regulation and interaction of its gene products. Many regulatory networks hardwire these gene expression patterns through the use of specialized DNA sequences surrounding genes. These DNA sequences are bound by one or more specific transcription factors (TF). As such, TF are evolutionarily conserved crucial regulators of development. One example is the sole C. elegans member of the RFX (Regulatory Factor X) TF family, DAF-19. Recognition and binding of RFX TF/DAF-19 to a conserved 13-15 bp promoter sequence motif, the X-box, has proven to be the key regulatory step of cilia development in C. elegans and other organisms. Two thirds of the more than fifty direct target genes of DAF-19 identified to date in C. elegans are expressed in most or all ciliated sensory neurons (CSN), while one third are only expressed in specific subsets of CSN. In gene expression studies using transgenic C. elegans lines we investigated if the X-box itself or its position within promoter regions had any influence on this phenomenon in three different ways: (i) by changing the positions of X-boxes within promoters; (ii) by swapping X-boxes, whereby X-boxes of ciliary genes expressed in all CSN were replaced with X-boxes from ciliary genes expressed in a only a few CSN, and vice versa; (iii) by testing a 14 bp X-box by itself, without any surrounding promoter sequences. Our experiments clearly demonstrated that the X-box itself is not the only factor that determines ciliary gene expression. Instead, we have identified additional cis-regulatory motifs that work in concert with the X-box to establish the correct expression pattern of a given ciliary gene. Through bioinformatics and in vivo dissection of the promoter regions of several X-box/ciliary genes, we have identified an enhancer motif, the C-box. This motif is typically located in close proximity to an X-box (within less than 80 bp). The C-box enhancer is conserved in related nematode species and in coordination with the X-box determines the expression patterns of ciliary genes. Ciliary genes that are expressed in most or all CSN are typically equipped with C-boxes, while genes that are expressed in only a few CSN typically have none. Our experiments clearly demonstrate that the proximity of the X-box relative to the translational start site does not play a significant role, as long as it is less than 300 bp upstream of the ATG. Instead, the X-box - together with additional cis-regulatory motifs - works in concert to establish the expression patterns of ciliary genes. We have identified one of these cis-regulatory motifs, the evolutionarily conserved C-box enhancer.",WBPaper00039728,Transcriptional regulation of ciliary genes in C. elegans.,International Worm Meeting,2011,"Burghoorn, J|Piasecki, BP|Jeppsson, KE|Crona, F|Sahlin, S|Phirke, P|Swoboda, P"
"DAF-19 is the sole member of the RFX transcription factor family in C. elegans. A rescuing translational gfp fusion of daf-19 is mainly expressed in ciliated sensory neurons. In those neurons DAF-19 governs the expression of a large number of genes necessary for cilium structure and function. Consequently, mutations in daf-19 lead to the complete loss of all ciliated structures, resulting in a Dyf (dye-filling defective) phenotype. Previously it was shown by sequencing of ESTs and 5'-RACE that daf-19 encodes two transcripts, which differ in the alternatively spliced exon 4. Expression of a genomic construct comprising all 12 exons of daf-19 plus a 3 kb promoter region rescues all cilia-related phenotypes of the daf-19 mutant, like Dyf, and activates cilium specific, direct target genes. We now discovered a third, short isoform transcribed from a promoter located within the gene. Antibody stainings and gfp expression studies showed that it is this novel, short isoform, which is specifically expressed in ciliated sensory neurons. By contrast, the two longer isoforms have a much broader expression including most, if not all non-ciliated neurons. Given the distinct expression patterns of the three isoforms we now ask: what is the function of each of the DAF-19 isoforms? To identify and separate their functions, we generated daf-19 mutant strains carrying transgenic genomic or cDNA rescue fragments capable of expressing all three, or only one of the isoforms, respectively. We are currently using these transgenic strains in comparative studies to identify additional phenotypes and direct target genes that are related to the functions of the three different daf-19 isoforms.",WBPaper00028101,We would really like to know what all those Isoforms of the DAF-19 Transcription Factor are doing in all those Neurons,"Neuronal Development, Synaptic Function, and Behavior Meeting",2006,Gabriele Gahmon|Peter Swoboda
"In an previous study (Burr, 1985), it was reported that for monochromatic stimuli ranging from 420-680 nm, reversal bouts were elicited at five wavelengths from 520-600 nm (sample sizes were 200-400). At saturating intensities, the 10 s stimulus increased the probability of a reversal to 0.21 from a 0.12 background level due to spontaneous reversals. This increment corresponds to one response elicited for every 11 light presentations, on average. With such a low probability of response on top of a spontaneous background, a large sample size and paired statistics is required to achieve significance. To facilitate further investigation, we have developed a computer-video automated tracking system which scores reversals of up to 23 worms simultaneously and we here report the first results obtained with this system. Time resolution was one second, and sample sizes were on the order of 1000. Habituation was negligible over 15 cycles with 50 s of darkness alternating with a 10-second broad-band (360-610 nm) stimulus at saturating intensity. For statistical analysis, the 10 s stimulus period was paired with the preceding 10 s of darkness. Most responses occurred 1-7 s after light onset with a peak probability at 3 s. The incremental probability of a reversal was of the same order as observed previously. In both this and the earlier study, filtering the stimulus beam with 5 cm water and blocking filters is aimed at eliminating any far- and near-infrared light that could heat the worm or arena. That this was accomplished was supported by tests and analysis in the previous study. To confirm that the response was to light, not a temperature change, we repeated the above experiment under identical conditions except for an additional filter which blocked all wavelengths shorter than 630 nm light while transmitting infrared. The incremental response during the shutter-open period was eliminated, confirming that light elicits reversals. We have initiated experiments with mutants aimed at narrowing the possible candidates for the light-sensitive receptor neuron. So far, we have found that light sensitivity is retained in ttx-1 and lost in daf-19. Considering the known morphological effects of these mutations (Perkins et al., 1986), it would appear that the structural integrity of the fingers in AFD is not essential for light sensitivity but the presence of cilia in one or more ciliated sensory neurons probably is.

"It is crucial to correctly detect and interpret environmental signals. Studying the development and mechanisms of sensory perception is challenging in organisms with complex neuronal networks. The worm C. elegans possesses a simple neuronal network of 302 neurons that includes 60 ciliated sensory neurons (CSN) for detecting external sensory input. C. elegans is thus an excellent model in which to study sensory neuron development, function and behavior. We have generated a genetic rescue system that allows in vivo analyses of isolated CSN at both cellular and systemic levels. We used the RFX transcription factor DAF-19, a key regulator of ciliogenesis. Mutations in daf-19 result in the complete absence of all sensory cilia and thus of external sensory input. In daf-19 mutants we used cell-specific rescue of DAF-19 function in selected neurons, thereby generating animals with single, fully functional CSN. Otherwise and elsewhere these animals are completely devoid of any environmental input through cilia. We demonstrated the rescue of fully functional, single cilia using fluorescent markers, sensory behavioral assays, and calcium imaging. Our technique, called FRISSC (Functional Rescue In Single Sensory Cilia), can thus cell-autonomously and cell- specifically restore the function of single sensory neurons and their ability to respond to sensory input. FRISSC can be adapted to many different CSNs, and thus constitutes an excellent tool to study sensory behaviors, both in single animals and populations of worms. It will be very useful for the molecular dissection of sensory perception in CSN and for the analysis of developmental aspects of ciliogenesis.",WBPaper00035359,Worms with a single functional sensory cilium generate proper neuron-specific behavioral output,European Worm Neurobiology Meeting,2009,Gabriele Senti|Marina Ezcurra|Jana Lobner|William R Schafer|Peter Swoboda
"The dendritic ends of most C. elegans sensory neurons terminate with primary cilia, microtubule-based structures critical for the sensory functions of these cells. Though primary cilia occur in various cell types in animals, little is known about specific tubulins that determine their characteristic architecture and function.  We carried out a microarray-based screen for genes expressed in male tail sensory rays, each of which contains two ciliated neurons.  This approach identified the beta-tubulin tbb-4, one of six beta-tubulins in the C. elegans genome. Other bioinformatics approaches have suggested two potential alpha-tubulin partners, tba-6 and tba-9.  To study the expression of these tubulins, we have created and analyzed transcriptional and translational YFP fusions. A tbb-4 transcriptional fusion is expressed in ciliated neurons, including amphid, phasmid and labial neurons in both sexes, and ray neurons in males. The TBB-4 translational fusion is specifically localized to the tips of dendrites in these neurons, indicating that TBB-4 is likely to be a component of ciliary microtubules.  The tba-6 transcriptional fusion is expressed in labial neurons and bodywall muscles in both sexes, the HSN, and male tail rays.  We are currently constructing translational YFP fusions with tba-6 and tba-9.  To determine the role of these tubulins in vivo, we have created single and double mutant combinations of tbb-4(ok1461) and tba-6(cxTi4018) in a background containing OSM-6::GFP.  Single tbb-4 and tba-6 mutations do not disrupt OSM-6::GFP localization along cilia, nor does the double mutant.  We are currently using RNAi to reduce expression of tba-9 in these genetic backgrounds.  The tbb-4 promoter contains a putative X-box, suggesting that it could be directly regulated by the RFX transcription factor DAF-19.  A recognizable X-box does not appear in the promoter of either tba-6 or tba-9.  To determine if the X-box is necessary to drive expression of tbb-4 in ciliated neurons, we constructed a tbb-4promoter::YFP fusion in which the X-box was deleted.  Preliminary observations suggest that the X-box is required for high levels of tbb-4 expression.  In addition, to determine if DAF-19 is required for tbb-4 expression, we plan to analyze the expression of our tubulin promoter::YFP constructs in a daf-19 mutant",WBPaper00028247,Tubulins in sensory cilia,"Neuronal Development, Synaptic Function, and Behavior Meeting",2006,Daryl Hurd|Woo-sin Park|Douglas Portman
"Monitoring Editor: Marcos Gonzalez-Gaitan Neurons form elaborate subcellular structures such as dendrites, axons, cilia, and synapses to receive signals from their environment and transmit them to the respective target cells. In the worm C. elegans, lack of the RFX transcription factor DAF-19 leads to the complete absence of cilia normally found on 60 sensory neurons. We now describe and functionally characterize three different isoforms of DAF-19. The short isoform DAF-19C is specifically expressed in ciliated sensory neurons and sufficient to rescue all cilia-related phenotypes of daf-19 mutants. In contrast, the long isoforms DAF-19A/B function in basically all nonciliated neurons. We discovered behavioral and cellular phenotypes in daf-19 mutants that depend on the isoforms daf-19a/b. These novel synaptic maintenance phenotypes are reminiscent of synaptic decline seen in many human neurodegenerative disorders.

"Mutation in the Caenorhabditis elegans gene osm-6 was previously shown to result in defects in the ultrastructure of sensory cilia and defects in chemosensory and mechanosensory behaviors. We have cloned osm-6 by transposon tagging and transformation rescue and have identified molecular lesions associated with five osm-6 mutations. The osm-6 gene encodes a protein that is 40% identical in amino acid sequence to a predicted mammalian protein of unknown function. We fused osm-6 with the gene for green fluorescent protein (GFP); the fusion gene rescued the osm-6 mutant phenotype and showed accumulation of GFP in ciliated sensory neurons exclusively. The OSM-6::GFP protein was localized to cytoplasm, including processes and dendritic endings where sensory cilia are situated. Mutations in other genes known to cause ciliary defects led to changes in the appearance of OSM-6::GFP in dendritic endings or, in the case of daf-19, reduced OSM-6::GFP accumulation. We conclude from an analysis of genetic mosaics that osm-6 acts cell autonomously in affecting cilium structure.",WBPaper00002980,"Analysis of osm-6, a gene that affects sensory cilium structure and sensory neuron function in Caenorhabditis elegans.",Genetics,1998,Collet J|Spike CA|Lundquist EA|Shaw JE|Herman RK
"Sensory organs are composed of sensory neuron dendrites surrounded by ensheathing glial-like cells. We are interested in understanding sensory organ morphogenesis. The generation of sensory organ morphology is dependent on the formation of a tube by the ensheathing cells and the coordination of this lumen with the sensory neuron processes. To understand how tube morphogenesis is coupled to sensory neuron development, we are studying the morphogenesis of the C. elegans amphid sensory organ. To gain insight into the genetic basis of sensory organ morphogenesis, we characterized daf-6 . daf-6 encodes a sterol-sensing domain containing protein related to Drosophila and vertebrate Patched. Microscopy analysis suggests that daf-6 sensory defects are due to a failure to generate a proper tube within the amphid sheath cells. Mosaic analysis demonstrated that daf-6 functions in the amphid sheath cells(1), and heat shock rescue experiments revealed that daf-6 is required in the amphid during a narrow window of embryogenesis when the amphid sheath lumen forms. DAF-6 is expressed in and lines the luminal surfaces of the amphid sheath and socket cells, as well as other tube cells, including the phasmid sheath and socket cells, excretory system cells, vulval cells, and rectal cells, suggesting that daf-6 may play a general role in lumen formation. In animals mutant for both daf-6 and che-14 , a C. elegans Dispatched homolog, the excretory canal lumen is malformed, and embryos do not pass through the vulva opening. Thus, daf-6 functions with che-14 to regulate proper lumen formation. To address the coordination of amphid sheath lumen development with formation of the ciliated ending of the sensory neurons, we examined daf-19 mutants, which lack sensory neuron cilia. We have observed several sheath cell defects, most notably an alteration in the pattern of DAF-6::GFP localization in the amphid sheath tube. Currently, we are attempting to determine whether this defect is due to a defect in amphid lumen formation or a more selective defect in DAF-6 subcellular localization. We are also interested in identifying additional genes that function with daf-6 to regulate amphid morphogenesis. To do so, we are carrying out genetic screens to identify daf-6 suppressors or enhancers. Our results will be presented at the meeting. (1) Herman R.K. (1987).

"In Caenorhabditis elegans, formation of the developmentally arrested dauer larva is induced by high levels of a constitutively secreted pheromone. Synergy between two groups of incompletely penetrant dauer-constitutive (Daf-c) mutations has recently led to a proposal that these two groups of genes are partially redundant and function in two parallel pathways that regulate dauer formation. A possible weakness in this reasoning is that the mutations used to identify the synergy were specifically obtained as incompletely penetrant mutations. Here we use screens to identify new Daf-c alleles without any requirement for partial penetrance. Nevertheless, 22 of the 25 new mutations are incompletely penetrant mutations in 6 previously identified genes. Among these are mutations in daf-8 and daf-19, genes for which only one mutation had been previously identified. Also included in this group are three daf-1 alleles that do not exhibit the maternal rescue characteristic of other daf-1 alleles. Two of the 25 new mutations are fully penetrant and are alleles of daf-2, the one gene in which a fully penetrant mutation had been found earlier. Finally, one of the 25 new mutations is semidominant, temperature-sensitive, and identifies a new gene, daf-28. The results demonstrate that an incompletely penetrant Daf-c phenotype is characteristic of mutations in most Daf-c genes other than daf-2. This finding strengthens the hypothesis that a branched genetic pathway controls dauer formation.",WBPaper00001923,A screen for nonconditional dauer-constitutive mutations in Caenorhabditis elegans.,Genetics,1994,Malone EA|Thomas JH
"Cilia are ubiquitous cell surface projections that mediate various sensory- and motility-based processes and are implicated in a growing number of multi-organ genetic disorders termed ciliopathies. To identify new components required for cilium biogenesis and function, we sought to further define and validate the transcriptional targets of DAF-19, the ciliogenic C. elegans RFX transcription factor. Transcriptional profiling of daf-19 mutants (which do not form cilia) and wild-type animals was performed using embryos staged to when the cell types developing cilia in the worm, the ciliated sensory neurons (CSNs), still differentiate. Comparisons between the two populations revealed 881 differentially regulated genes with greater than a 1.5-fold increase or decrease in expression. A subset of these was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. Transgenic worms expressing transcriptional GFP fusions revealed CSN-specific expression patterns for 11 of 14 candidate genes. We show that two uncharacterized candidate genes, termed dyf-17 and dyf-18 because their corresponding mutants display dye-filling (Dyf) defects, are important for ciliogenesis. DYF-17 localizes at the base of cilia and is specifically required for building the distal segment of sensory cilia. DYF-18 is an evolutionarily conserved CDK7/CCRK/LF2p-related serine/threonine kinase that is necessary for the proper function of intraflagellar transport, a process critical for cilium biogenesis. Together, our microarray study identifies targets of the evolutionarily conserved RFX transcription factor, DAF-19, providing a rich dataset from which to uncover-in addition to DYF-17 and DYF-18-cellular components important for cilium formation and function.",WBPaper00039866,Transcriptional profiling of C. elegans DAF-19 uncovers a ciliary base-associated protein and a CDK/CCRK/LF2p-related kinase required for intraflagellar transport.,Dev Biol,2011,Phirke P|Efimenko E|Mohan S|Burghoorn J|Crona F|Bakhoum MW|Trieb M|Schuske K|Jorgensen EM|Piasecki BP|Leroux MR|Swoboda P
"C. elegans relies on sensory cues to find food. In the absence of such cues, the worm might display defined search patterns or other stereotyped behavior. We sought to characterize the motion of C. elegans in the absence of stimuli, over time scales comparable to that of starvation. To this end, we devised an imaging setup employing several flatbed scanners, which enables us to collect animals' paths over large (24 cm x 24 cm) surfaces. Wild-type worms display striking behavior in the absence of food. ~60% of the animals' paths display persistence in the direction of motion over length scales that are 50-100 times the body-length of C. elegans. The direction of movement differs from animal to animal, suggesting that the bias we observe might not represent a taxis towards an external cue. We confirmed these results with a camera imaging setup, in a more stringently homogeneous environment. Interestingly, directionality does not appear to arise from local correlation in the direction of motion. Furthermore, synthetic trajectories generated from the same angle and step distributions of individual trajectories indicate that the observed persistence in direction cannot be accounted for by simple random walk models. To determine whether sensory input is required for directionality, we analyzed the paths of sensory mutants. che-2 animals, which display cilia defects, exhibit non-directional behavior. Surprisingly, however, ~20% of daf-19 mutants, which lack cilia, display directionality. Mutations in osm-9, a TRPV channel required in several sensory neurons, do not affect behavior. By contrast, mutations in the cGMP-gated channel tax-4 result in loss of directionality, indicating a requirement for the activity of sensory neurons. To further investigate the role of sensory perception we performed rescue experiments of TAX-4 function. No rescue is observed when driving TAX-4 in the thermosensory neuron AFD or in the olfactory neurons AWB and AWC. Moreover, mutants defective in signal transduction for thermotaxis, odortaxis, phototaxis, and aerotaxis do not display loss of directionality. We observe partial rescue of directionality when driving TAX-4 in a set of five cells: the oxygen-sensing AQR, PQR and URX neurons and the ASJ and ASK neurons. In conclusion, our results suggest that the motion of C. elegans in the absence of apparent sensory cues cannot be assimilated to a random walk, and raise the intriguing speculative possibility that C. elegans might achieve directional motion by relying solely on self-based information.",WBPaper00039398,Biased motion in unbiased environments: are the worms navigating?,International Worm Meeting,2011,"Peliti, Margherita|Chuang, John|Leibler, Stanislas|Shaham, Shai"
"Parasitic nematodes represent formidable pathogens of humans, livestock and crop plants. Control of these parasites is almost exclusively dependent on a small group of anthelmintic drugs, the most important of which belong to the macrocyclic lactone class. The extensive use of these drugs to control the ubiquitous trichostrongylid parasites of grazing livestock has resulted in the emergence of both single and multi-drug resistance. The expectation is that this resistance will eventually occur in the human parasites such as the common and debilitating soil transmitted nematodes and vector-borne filarial nematodes. While the modes of action of anthelmintics such as ivermectin (IVM), have been elucidated, notably in the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the molecular nature of this resistance remains to be fully determined. Here we show that the anterior amphids play a key role in IVM uptake and mutations in these sensory structures result in IVM resistance in C. elegans. Random genetic mutant screens, detailed analysis of existing amphid mutants and lipophilic dye uptake indicate that the non-motile ciliated amphid neurons are a major route of IVM ingress; the majority of the mutants characterized in this study are predicted to be involved in intraflagellar transport. In addition to a role in IVM resistance, a subset of the amphid mutants are resistant to the non-related benzimidazole class of anthelmintics, raising the potential link to a multi-drug resistance mechanism. The amphid structures are present in all nematodes and are clearly defined in a drug-sensitive strain of Haemonchus contortus. It is predicted that amphidial drug uptake and intraflagellar transport may prove to be significant in the development of single and multi-drug resistance in the nematode pathogens of veterinary and human importance.",WBPaper00055368,The sensory amphidial structures of Caenorhabditis elegans are involved in macrocyclic lactone uptake and anthelmintic resistance.,Int J Parasitol,2018,Page AP
"Cilia are important for the interaction with environments and the proper function of tissues. While the basic structure of cilia is well conserved, ciliated cells have various functions. To understand the distinctive identities of ciliated cells, the identification of cell-specific proteins and its regulation is essential. Here, we report the mechanism that confers a specific identity on IL2 neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans, neurons important for the dauer larva-specific nictation behavior. We show that DAF-19M, an isoform of the sole C. elegans RFX transcription factor DAF-19, heads a regulatory subroutine, regulating target genes through an X-box motif variant under the control of terminal selector proteins UNC-86 and CFI-1 in IL2 neurons. Considering the conservation of DAF-19M module in IL2 neurons for nictation and in male-specific neurons for mating behavior, we propose the existence of an evolutionarily adaptable, hard-wired genetic module for distinct behaviors that share the feature ""recognizing the environment.""",WBPaper00063946,The C. elegans regulatory factor X (RFX) DAF-19M module: A shift from general ciliogenesis to cell-specific ciliary and behavioral specialization.,Cell Rep,2022,Ahn S|Yang H|Son S|Lee HS|Park D|Yim H|Choi HJ|Swoboda P|Lee J
"Dauer is a dormancy state that may occur at the end of developmental stage L1 or L2 of Caenorhabditis elegans when the environmental conditions are unfavorable (e.g., lack of food, high temperature, or overcrowding) for further growth. Dauer is a nonaging duration that does not affect the postdauer adult lifespan. Major molecular events would include the sensing of the environmental cues, the transduction of the signals into the cells, and the subsequent integration of the signals that result in the corresponding alteration of the metabolism and morphology of the organism. Genetics approach has been effectively used in identifying many of the so-called daf genes involved in dauer formation using C. elegans as the model. Nevertheless, biochemical studies at the protein and metabolic level has been lacking behind in understanding this important life phenomenon. This review focuses on the biochemical understanding so far achieved on dauer formation and dormancy in general, as well as important issues that need to be addressed in the future.",WBPaper00033400,Understanding the mechanism of the dormant dauer formation of C. elegans: from genetics to biochemistry.,IUBMB Life,2009,Wang Y|Ezemaduka AN|Tang Y|Chang Z
"DAF-19 is an RFX-transcription factor (Regulatory Factor binding to the X-box), which has been shown to be essential for the development of cilia on 60 sensory neurons in C. elegans. Mutations in daf-19 lead to the complete loss of all ciliated structures, but leave the cell bodies and neurites of these neurons intact. DAF-19 has been shown to regulate a large number of cilium-specific genes encoding structural and functional cilium components as well as other transcription factors. This finding suggests a very central role of DAF-19 during ciliogenesis. Since DAF-19 is essential for the formation of cilia, we hypothesize that it could also be sufficient. We try to answer this question by expressing the daf-19 gene from heterologous promoters in cells that usually do not carry cilia with the aim of inducing ectopic cilia. When expressed in tail hypodermis cells, daf-19 leads to morphological changes of the hermaphrodite tail and to the ectopic expression of daf-19 target genes. Several of these cells do not show hypodermal cell characteristics anymore, but seem to display more neuron-like features (e.g. processes). Currently we are characterizing in detail to what extent the ectopic expression of daf-19 can transform hypodermis cells into neuronal or even cilium-carrying cells.",WBPaper00025293,"Ectopic expression of DAF-19, a transcription factor that controls cilium development",International Worm Meeting,2005,Gabriele G K Gahmon|Juan Carlos Fierro Gonzalez|Peter Swoboda
"Eight classes of chemosensory neurons in C. elegans fill with fluorescein when living animals are placed in a dye solution. Fluorescein enters the neurons through their exposed sensory cilia. Mutations in 14 genes prevent dye uptake and disrupt chemosensory behaviors. Each of these genes affects the ultrastructure of the chemosensory cilia or their accessory cells. In each case, the cilia are shorter or less exposed than normal, suggesting that dye contact is the principal factor under selection. Ten genes affect many or all of the sensory cilia in the head. The daf-19 (m86) mutation eliminates all cilia, leaving only occasional centrioles in the dendrites. The cilia in che-13 (e1805), osm-1 (p808), osm-5 (p813), and osm-6 (p811) mutants have normal transition zones and severely shortened axonemes. Doublet-microtubules, attached to the membrane by Y links, assemble ectopically proximal to the cilia in these mutants. The amphid cilia in che-11 (e1810) are irregular in diameter and contain dark ground material in the middle of the axonemes. Certain mechanocilia are also affected. The amphid cilia in che-10 (e1809) apparently degenerate, leaving dendrites with bulb-shaped endings filled with dark ground material. The mechanocilia lack striated rootlets. Cilia defects have also been found in che-2, che-3, and daf- 10 mutants. The osm-3 (p802) mutation specifically eliminates the distal segment of the amphid cilia. Mutations in three genes affect sensillar support cells. The che-12 (e1812) mutation eliminates matrix material normally secreted by the amphid sheath cell. The che- 14 (e1960) mutation disrupts the joining of the amphid sheath and socket cells to form the receptor channel. A similar defect has been observed in daf-6 mutants. Four additional genes affect specific classes of ciliated sensory neurons. The mec-1 and mec-8 (e398) mutations disrupt the fasciculation of the amphid cilia.

"The Gram-negative bacterium Shigella flexneri is the causative agent of shigellosis, a diarrhoeal disease also known as bacillary dysentery. S. flexneri infects the colonic and rectal epithelia of its primate host and induces a cascade of inflammatory responses that culminates in the destruction of the host intestinal lining. Molecular characterization of host-pathogen interactions in this infection has been challenging due to the host specificity of S. flexneri strains, as it strictly infects humans and non-human primates. Recent studies have shown that S. flexneri infects the soil dwelling nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, however, the interactions between S. flexneri and C. elegans at the cellular level and the cause of nematode death are unknown. Here we attempt to gain insight into the complex host-pathogen interactions between S. flexneri and C. elegans. Using transmission electron microscopy, we show that live S. flexneri cells accumulate in the nematode intestinal lumen, produce outer membrane vesicles and invade nematode intestinal cells. Using two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis we identified host proteins that are differentially expressed in response to S. flexneri infection. Four of the identified genes, aco-1, cct-2, daf-19 and hsp-60, were knocked down using RNAi and ACO-1, CCT-2 and DAF-19, which were identified as up-regulated in response to S. flexneri infection, were found to be involved in the infection process. aco-1 RNAi worms were more resistant to S. flexneri infection, suggesting S. flexneri-mediated disruption of host iron homeostasis. cct-2 and daf-19 RNAi worms were more susceptible to infection, suggesting that these genes are induced as a protective mechanism by C. elegans. These observations further our understanding of the processes involved in S. flexneri infection of C. elegans, which is immensely beneficial to the routine use of this new in vivo model to study S. flexneri pathogenesis.",WBPaper00045693,Shigella flexneri infection in Caenorhabditis elegans: cytopathological examination and identification of host responses.,PLoS One,2014,George DT|Behm CA|Hall DH|Mathesius U|Rug M|Nguyen KC|Verma NK
"Aging is characterized by a global decline in physiological function. However, by constructing a complete single-cell gene expression atlas, we find that Caenorhabditis elegans aging is not random in nature but instead is characterized by coordinated changes in functionally related metabolic, proteostasis, and stress-response genes in a cell-type-specific fashion, with downregulation of energy metabolism being the only nearly universal change. Similarly, the rates at which cells age differ significantly between cell types. In some cell types, aging is characterized by an increase in cell-to-cell variance, whereas in others, variance actually decreases. Remarkably, multiple resilience-enhancing transcription factors known to extend lifespan are activated across many cell types with age; we discovered new longevity candidates, such as GEI-3, among these. Together, our findings suggest that cells do not age passively but instead react strongly, and individualistically, to events that occur during aging.

"Individual cell types can elaborate morphologically diverse cilia. Cilia are assembled via intraflagellar transport (IFT) of ciliary precursors; however, the mechanisms that generate ciliary diversity are unknown. Here, we examine IFT in the structurally distinct cilia of the ASH/ASI and the AWB chemosensory neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans, enabling us to compare IFT in specific cilia types. We show that unlike in the ASH/ASI cilia, the OSM-3 kinesin moves independently of the kinesin-II motor in the AWB cilia. Although OSM-3 is essential to extend the distal segments of the ASH/ASI cilia, it is not required to build the AWB distal segments. Mutations in the fkh-2 forkhead domain gene result in AWB-specific defects in ciliary morphology, and FKH-2 regulates kinesin-II subunit gene expression specifically in AWB. Our results suggest that cell-specific regulation of IFT contributes to the generation of ciliary diversity, and provide insights into the networks coupling the acquisition of ciliary specializations with other aspects of cell fate.",WBPaper00029400,Distinct IFT mechanisms contribute to the generation of ciliary structural diversity in C. elegans.,EMBO J,2007,Mukhopadhyay S|Lu Y|Qin H|Lanjuin A|Shaham S|Sengupta P
"Cytoplasmic dynein is involved in a wide variety of cellular functions. In addition to the initially characterized form (MAP 1Cdynein 1), a second form of cytoplasmic dynein (dynein 2) has been identified and implicated in intraflagellar transport (IFT) in lower eukaryotes and in Golgi organization in vertebrates. In the current study, the primary structure of the full-length dynein 2 heavy chain (HC) was determined from cDNA sequence. The dynein 1 and dynein 2 sequences were similar within the motor region, and around the light intermediate chain (LIC)-binding site within the N-terminal stem region. The dynein 2 HC co-immunoprecipitated with LIC3, a homologue of dynein 1 LICs. Dynein 2 mRNA was abundant in the ependymal layer of the neural tube and in the olfactory epithelium. Antibodies to dynein 2 HC, LIC3 and a component of IFT particles strongly stained the ependymal layer lining the lateral ventricles.

"The hook sensory neuron HOB mediates vulva location behavior during Caenorhabditis elegans male mating. We screened for mutations that affect HOB gene expression and isolated an allele of zinc finger transcription factor egl-46. Mutations in egl-46 are defective in vulva location, indicating a disruption of HOB function. Establishment of primary neuronal fate of HOB, cell position and morphology, and dendritic process to the male hook are normal in the egl-46(-) males. EGL-46 regulates HOB-specific expression of polycystins lov-1 and pkd-2, homeodomain gene ceh-26, and neuropeptide-like protein nlp-8, but is not required for expression of general cilium structure genes osm-5 and osm-6 in the HOB neuron. By contrast, RFX-like transcription factor daf-19 is not only an upstream key regulator in general cilium formation pathway, but also affects the expression of pkd-2, ceh-26, and nlp-8 in a non-HOB-specific manner. Therefore, egl-46 regulates a cell-specific program to define sensory specificity for HOB neuronal function.

"Prior studies from our laboratory and others have demonstrated two layers of transcriptional regulation of the serotonin-biosynthesis enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase tph-1 in the ciliated chemosensory neurons ADF. The OCR-2/OSM-9 TRPV channel regulates the basal tph-1 expression under optimal growth conditions (Zhang et al., 2004). Stress conditions or mutations of the sensory cilia further upregulate tph-1 expression in ADFs (Zhang et al., 2005; Chang et al., 2006; Moussaif and Sze, 2009; Shivers et al., 2009). To identify new genes involved in the regulation of tph-1 expression in the ADF neurons, two genetic screens were carried out. We identified that yz58, a gain-of-function allele of the Toll-interleukin 1 receptor domain protein TIR-1, restored tph-1 expression in the ocr-2 mutant background. Characterization of mutations that suppress tph-1 upregulation by tir-1 (yz58) led to the identification of two daf-19 alleles. Interestingly, both mutations are located in the DAF-19 dimerization domain. Mutations in DAF-19 do not affect the expression of CAT-1/VMAT, indicating that the mutations do not transform the ADF serotonergic cell fate. Further analysis suggests that DAF-19 also interacts with TIR-1 signaling in other cellular and physiological functions. References Chang AJ, Chronis N, Karow DS, Marletta MA, Bargmann CI. 2006.

"Small GTPases of the Ras superfamily are key regulators of diverse cellular and developmental events, including differentiation, cell division, vesicle transport, nuclear assembly, and control of the cytoskeleton. The C. elegans genome encodes 56 members of the major Ras GTPase subfamilies, including the Ras/Ral/Rap family, the Rho family, the Rab family, Ran, and the Arf/Sar family. Studies in C. elegans have shown that Ras/Rap family members control cell fate specification and differentiation; Rho GTPases control morphogenesis and actin dynamics, including axon pathfinding and cell migration; Rab GTPases control synaptic vesicle trafficking and release and gene expression responses in innate immunity; the Ran GTPase controls nuclear import/export, nuclear reassembly after mitosis, and kinetechore association with microtubules; and Arf/Sar GTPases control morphogenesis and microtubule organization and possibly cilia development.

"RFX transcription factors play important roles in cilia biogenesis and maintenance by transcriptionally regulate ciliary genes. Their target genes have been associated with a number of disease conditions collectively called ciliopathies. daf-19 is the only known member of the RFX family in C. elegans. RFX regulation of ciliary genes is conserved between humans and C. elegans. The DNA binding site, known as the X-box motif, is also conserved. Thus, C. elegans has been effectively used as a model organism to identify RFX target genes. Past studies have identified target genes by searching for X-box motifs in C. elegans using bioinformatics, functional genomics, and comparative genomics methods. All of the DAF-19 target genes studied to date possess a single consensus X-box motif. Some genes (bbs-2 and osm-5) were found to possess two X-box motifs. We hypothesize that tandem X-box motifs could have cooperative roles. To test this hypothesis, we compared the gene sets between 4 Caenorhabditis species to find C. elegans genes with multiple X-box motifs within 500-bp promoter region. The C. elegans gene set is an extensively curated set, but this is not the case for the remaining Caenorhabditis species. In order to employ comparative genomics for X-box motif searches, we improved the gene sets for 3 Caenorhabditis species using genBlastG, a homology based gene predictor that we recently developed. Using comparative genomics with the improved gene set, we identified 15 genes that have conserved X-box motifs in all species and have multiple X-box motifs in C. elegans. We examined one gene, F25B4.2, in detail. Using singly integrated reporter constructs, we have shown that F25B4.2 is expressed in ciliated neurons. This expression is dependent on the two 15-bp X-box motifs as well as DAF-19 indicating that F25B4.2 is a DAF-19 target gene. When the proximal motif is removed, expression in ciliated neurons is ablated. When the distal motif is removed, we observed an elevated expression suggesting the distal motif has a repressive role. This is the first to report a putative repressive X-box motif in C. elegans. Our data suggest that two X-box motifs cooperate together to regulate specific expression level of F25B4.2. We model that having multiple X-box motifs in the promoter could achieve specific expression level. Our identifications of X-box motifs will improve our understanding on RFX mediated regulation in C. elegans and in other organisms including humans.",WBPaper00039675,Comparative genomics reveals novel regulatory mechanism for the transcription factor RFX/DAF-19 in C. elegans.,International Worm Meeting,2011,"Chu, Jeffrey S C|Tarailo-Graovac, Maja|Wang, Jun|Uyar, Bora|Tu, Domena|Trinh, Joanne|Johnsen, Bob|Baillie, David|Chen, Nansheng"
"Cilia and flagella play important roles in many physiological processes, including cell and fluid movement, sensory perception, and development [Scholey, 2003]. The biogenesis and maintenance of cilia depend on intraflagellar transport (IFT), a motility process that operates bidirectionally along the ciliary axoneme [Scholey, 2003; Rosenbaum et al., 2002]. Disruption in IFT and cilia function causes several human disorders, including polycystic kidneys, retinal dystrophy, neurosensory impairment, and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) [Pazour et al., 2002; Katsanis et al., 2001; Ansley et al., 2003]. To uncover new ciliary components, including IFT proteins, we compared C. elegans ciliated neuronal and nonciliated cells through serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) and screened for genes potentially regulated by the ciliogenic transcription factor, DAF-19 [Swoboda et al., 2000]. Using these complementary approaches, we identified numerous candidate ciliary genes and confirmed the ciliated-cell-specific expression of 14 novel genes. One of these, C27H5.7a, encodes a ciliary protein that undergoes IFT. As with other IFT proteins, its ciliary localization and transport is disrupted by mutations in IFT and bbs genes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the ciliary structural defect of C. elegans dyf-13(mn396) mutants is caused by a mutation in C27H5.7a. Together, our findings help define a ciliary transcriptome and suggest that DYF-13, an evolutionarily conserved protein, is a novel core IFT component required for cilia function.",WBPaper00026601,"Functional genomics of the cilium, a sensory organelle.",Curr Biol,2005,Blacque OE|Perens EA|Boroevich KA|Inglis PN|Li C|Warner A|Khattra J|Holt RA|Ou G|Mah AK|McKay SJ|Huang P|Swoboda P|Jones SJM|Marra MA|Baillie DL|Moerman DG|Shaham S|Leroux MR
"Cilia are an important cellular differentiation of sensory neurons for receiving information from the environment. 60 of the 302 C. elegans neurons have ciliated endings, accounting for the bulk of informational input into the worm. Mutations in a large number of genes have been identified that affect the structure and function of these sensory cilia. One of these genes, daf-19 , encodes an RFX-type transcription factor. By acting through its target site in promoter regions, the x-box, DAF-19 appears to be the main regulator of a number of effector genes involved in sensory cilium formation. These effector genes, including che-2, osm-1, osm-5, osm-6 and daf-19 itself, are expressed in essentially all ciliated sensory neurons and, when mutated, cause morphological defects in sensory cilia. DAF-19 is also involved in the regulation of x-box containing genes that are expressed only in subsets of ciliated sensory neurons (e.g. odr-4 ). odr-4 is implicated in localizing odorant receptors to sensory cilia. Our results strongly suggest that DAF-19 regulates the structural and functional differentiation of sensory cilia by activating the transcription of a battery of genes whose products form the cilium and endow this structure with sensory functions. We initiated the identification of many more ciliary components by analyzing genes that have an appropriately spaced x-box promoter element, which we call xbx genes. In repeated searches through the C. elegans genome sequence (with Kerry Bubb, Genetics, UW), using an algorithm designed to find promoter elements, we uncovered hundreds of candidate xbx genes, several of which had C. briggsae and Drosophila homologues that also had an appropriately positioned x-box promoter element. Initial expression analyses of a subgroup of these xbx genes showed that some of them were specifically expressed in ciliated sensory neurons in a daf-19 dependent manner. Presently we are attempting to generate cilium specific phenotypes for some of the xbx genes using gene specific RNA interference techniques. To further characterize the set of genes that comprise the cilium formation module we are searching through promoter sequences of selected subsets of cilium specific and xbx genes for other conserved promoter elements (with Martin Tompa, Computer Sciences and Engineering, UW). In combination with previous data about sensory cilia, these approaches have the potential to reveal all the genes required for sensory cilium structure and function.",WBPaper00017999,The regulation of sensory cilia specific genes in C. elegans,International C. elegans Meeting,2001,Peter Swoboda|James H Thomas
"The PTEN tumour suppressor encodes a phosphatase, and its daf-18 orthologue in Caenorhabditis elegans negatively regulates the insulin/IGF-1 DAF-2 receptor pathway that influences lifespan in worms and other species. In order to identify new DAF-18 regulated pathways involved in aging, we initiated a candidate RNAi feeding screen for clones that lengthen lifespan. Here, we report that smg-1 inactivation increases average lifespan in a daf-18 dependent manner. Genetic analysis is consistent with SMG-1 acting at least in part in parallel to the canonical DAF-2 receptor pathway, but converging on the transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO. SMG-1 is a serine-threonine kinase which plays a conserved role in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) in worms and mammals. In addition, human SMG-1 has also been implicated in the p53-mediated response to genotoxic stress. The effect of smg-1 inactivation on lifespan appears to be unrelated to its NMD function, but requires the p53 tumour suppressor orthologue cep-1. Furthermore, smg-1 inactivation confers a resistance to oxidative stress in a daf-18-, daf-16- and cep-1-dependent manner. We propose that the role of SMG-1 in lifespan regulation is at least partly dependent on its function in oxidative stress resistance. Taken together, our results unveil a novel role for SMG-1 in lifespan regulation.",WBPaper00032237,A novel role for the SMG-1 kinase in lifespan and oxidative stress resistance in Caenorhabditis elegans.,PLoS One,2008,Masse I|Molin L|Mouchiroud L|Vanhems P|Palladino F|Billaud M|Solari F
"Sensory neuron cilia are evolutionarily conserved dendritic appendages that convert environmental stimuli into neuronal activity. Although several cilia components are known, the functions of many remain uncharacterized. Furthermore, the basis of morphological and functional differences between cilia remains largely unexplored. To understand the molecular basis of cilia morphogenesis and function, we studied the Caenorhabditis elegans mutants che-12 and dyf-11. These mutants fail to concentrate lipophilic dyes from their surroundings in sensory neurons, and are chemotaxis defective. In che-12 mutants, sensory neuron cilia lack distal segments, while in dyf-11 animals, medial and distal segments are absent. CHE-12 and DYF-11 are conserved ciliary proteins that function cell-autonomously and are continuously required for maintenance of cilium morphology and function. CHE-12, composed primarily of HEAT-repeats, may not be part of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) complex, and is not required for the localization of some IFT components. DYF-11 undergoes IFT-like movement and may function at an early stage of IFT-B particle assembly. Intriguingly, while DYF-11 is expressed in all C. elegans ciliated neurons, CHE-12 expression is restricted to some amphid sensory neurons, suggesting a specific role in these neurons.

"Dye-filling is a common method used to stain Caenorhabditis elegans sensory neurons in vivo. While the amphids and phasmids are easy to stain, a subset of sensory neurons, the IL2 neurons, are difficult to stain reproducibly. Here we examined the conditions under which the IL2 neurons take up the lipophilic fluorescent dye DiI. We find that IL2 dye-filling depends on salt concentration, but not osmolarity. Low salt prior and during incubation is important for efficient dye uptake. Additional parameters that affect dye-filling are the speed of shaking during incubation and the addition of detergents. Our modified dye-filling procedure provides a reliable method to distinguish mutant alleles that stain amphids and phasmids, IL2 neurons, or both. An additional benefit is that it can also stain the excretory duct. The method allows genetic screens to be performed to identify mutants that selectively affect only one of the sensory structures or the excretory duct.",WBPaper00035927,Conditions for dye-filling of sensory neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans.,J Neurosci Methods,2010,Tong YG|Burglin TR
"We are interested in understanding the mechanism by which food and pheromone signals are transduced to signal dauer arrest or non-dauer development. Don Riddle's group has identified a TGF-beta homologous pathway that is involved in this signal transduction process. daf-7 encodes a peptide ligand, and daf-1 and daf-4 encode transmembrane serine/threonine kinases that may be receptors for the daf-7 protein. Recent work by Takao Inoue, Annette Estevez and our laboratory (see abstract by A. Koweek and G. Patterson) has identified a family of genes that are likely to be involved in the signal transduction from these receptors; daf-8, daf-14, and daf-3 are all homologues of the drosophila gene Mad, which transduces signals from serine/threonine kinase receptors. The mechanism by which these receptors and Mad homologues transduce signal is unknown; we are identifying new genes that act in this pathway. In previous screens for suppressors of daf-7, the genes daf-3, daf-5 and daf-12 were identified by D. Riddle. We have identified four new genes that suppress daf-7. Two of the genes were identified by mutations that strongly suppress daf-7; the other two show weak suppression. We are trying to clone a strong suppressor called scd-1 (Suppressor of Constitutive Dauer formation--pronounced ""scud""). We isolated two alleles as suppressors of daf-7; Takao Inoue provided two alleles he isolated as suppressors or daf-14 and daf-8. We mapped the gene between lin-2 and unc-9 on X, and we are doing finer mapping as well as injecting candidate cosmids for rescue. We have also begun a screen for suppressors of daf-3. We are mutagenizing a daf-7 daf-3 strain (daf-7 is dauer constitutive, daf-3 is dauer defective, and the double mutant is dauer defective). We will screen for dauers at 25 degrees C. daf-2, daf-19 and daf-23 are the known dauer constitutive mutants epistatic to daf-3. We hope to get new mutations that, while not dauer constitutive on their own, suppress the daf-3 mutation and allow the daf-7 mutation to force dauer formation.

The sole RFX transcription factor in C. elegans, DAF-19, regulates the formation of ciliated sensory endings through activation of many different cilium structure genes. A repressor function for DAF-19 has not been described so far. Mutations in daf-19 lead to the loss of all ciliated structures of the 60 otherwise cilia bearing cells described in the worm. These ciliated sensory neurons, located mostly in the head and the tail, are required for chemosensation and dauer formation. Cilium structure mutants are unable to detect the dauer pheromone and therefore dauer-defective (Daf-d). However, daf-19 mutants form dauer larvae constitutively regardless of environmental circumstances (Daf-c). This raises the question of additional functions of the transcription factor aside from the creation of a subcellular structure. We raised antibodies against DAF-19 to investigate its expression during development. In wholemount stainings daf-19 expression can be observed in ciliated as well as non-ciliated cells. Furthermore, mutant analysis suggests a second variant of the DAF-19 protein that is not affected by an early stop mutation. Interestingly, two proteins can also be detected on western blots using total worm protein extracts of wild-type worms. Both protein isoforms are regulated temporally and are not expressed simultaneously at any of the investigated stages. In daf-19 mutants, the expression of the shorter isoform is initiated too early while the longer one is lost. This mutual exclusion can also be observed in rescue experiments and suggests a novel autoregulatory/repressor function of DAF-19. To understand the biological significance of the two different DAF-19 isoforms, we are currently trying to isolate and identify additional daf-19 transcripts. The potential functions of both isoforms in ciliogenesis and dauer formation will be discussed.",WBPaper00024760,DUAL ROLES OF DAF-19 DURING DEVELOPMENT?,European Worm Meeting,2004,G Gahmon|P Swoboda
"Cilia and flagella play critical roles in cell motility, development and sensory perception in animals. Formation and maintenance of cilia require a conserved protein transport system called intraflagellar transport (IFT). Here, we show that Caenorhabditis elegans dyf-11 encodes an evolutionarily conserved protein required for cilium biogenesis. dyf-11 is expressed in most of the ciliated neurons and is regulated by DAF-19, a crucial transcription factor for ciliary genes in C. elegans. dyf-11 mutants exhibit stunted cilia, fluorescent dye-filling defects (Dyf) of sensory neurons, and abnormal chemotaxis (Che). Cell- and stage-specific rescue experiments indicated that DYF-11 is required for formation and maintenance of sensory cilia in cell-autonomous manner. Fluorescent protein-tagged DYF-11 localizes to cilia and moves antero- and retrogradely via IFT. Analysis of DYF-11 movement in bbs mutants further suggested that DYF-11 is likely associated with IFT complex B. Domain analysis using DYF-11 deletion constructs revealed that the coiled-coil region is required for proper localization and ciliogenesis. We further show that Traf3ip1/MIP-T3, the mammalian orthologue of DYF-11, localizes to cilia in the MDCK renal epithelial cells.",WBPaper00031375,"Caenorhabditis elegans DYF-11, an orthologue of mammalian Traf3ip1/MIP-T3, is required for sensory cilia formation.",Genes Cells,2008,Kunitomo H|Iino Y
"Under adverse environmental conditions, C. elegans enters a stress resistant dauer stage. We discovered a wild-type dauer-specific phenotype wherein six inner labial sensory neurons (IL2) undergo dramatic reorganization including extensive arborization of the IL2 quadrant (IL2Q) neurons (see N. Schroeder et al abstract). To identify genes involved in dauer-specific IL2 remodeling , we used a candidate gene approach. Representative genes were examined from several molecular pathways: dauer formation, ciliogenesis and intraflagellar transport, Notch signaling, cell fate and axon guidance. For example, both UNC-86 and LIN-32 are transcription factors necessary for IL2 cell fate. Most unc-86 alleles are defective in IL2 formation. However, unc-86(n848) mutants show normal IL2 morphology in non-dauers, but defects in dauer-specific IL2 arbors. Interestingly, lin-32 mutants that form IL2 neurons show no obvious defects in arborization. The RFX-transcription factor DAF-19, is a master regulator of ciliogenesis. daf-19(m86) mutants lack all sensory cilia, but show extranumerary branching in the lateral IL2s suggesting a role for cilia in inhibiting arborization. 
   Through a forward genetic screen we identified kpc-1, a kex2-like proprotein convertase and furin homolog, as required for organized arborization in both dauer IL2 neurons (See N Schroeder et al abstract) and adult PVD and FLP multidendritic neurons (see Rashid et al abstract). To identify potential KPC-1 substrates, we cross referenced genes upregulated in PVDs (1), genes upregulated during dauer (2), and genes containing putative proprotein cleavage sites (3). We have assembled a list of 159 potential regulators of dendritic branching which we are beginning to characterize.

"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/RAS/MAPK signaling promotes cell growth and can drive tumorigenesis when overactive. Caenorhabditis elegans vulva development can model this pathway as signaling from the EGFR homolog LET-23 induces the vulval cell fate in vulva precursor cells (VPCs). The LIN-10 protein, along with LIN-2 and LIN-7, is essential for localization and activation of LET-23. In neurons, the RAB-6.2 GTPase and LIN-10 interact to mediate receptor trafficking. We expected RAB-6.2 to function similarly in the VPCs to promote EGFR signaling. However, we found that RAB-6.2 does not regulate LIN-10 localization in VPCs, and that rab-6.2 deletion suppresses the under-induced vulvaless phenotypes of lin-2(-) and lin-10(-) mutants, suggesting instead an antagonistic function in LET-23 signaling. In addition, rab-6.2(-) mutants show reduced expression from repetitive arrays, hinting at a role for RAB-6.2 in transgene silencing, a process regulated by small RNAs. VPS-52, a RAB-6.2 effector, promotes activity of the let-7 microRNA family, known to repress Ras in C. elegans and mammals. We hypothesize that RAB-6.2 supports the activity of the let-7 miRNA family, and through this negatively regulates EGFR/RAS/MAPK. We found that deletion of the let-7 family member mir-48 suppresses the vulvaless phenotype of lin-2(-) mutants, suggesting that mir-48 antagonizes LET-23-mediated vulva induction, in line with a RAB-6.2/let-7 family regulatory axis. Furthermore, rab-6.2(-) enhances the usually weak phenotypes of daf-19 and cel-1 RNAi, suggesting hypersensitivity to RNAi, which can result from increased availability of small RNA machinery in a background with reduced miRNA activity. Overall, our results pose RAB-6.2 as a negative regulator of LET-23-mediated vulva induction, and suggest that miRNA regulation may underlie this. Further genetic interaction tests and Ras reporters are needed to confirm miRNA regulation by RAB-6.2, and whether this underlies its antagonistic role in EGFR/Ras/MAPK signaling. These findings could expand our understanding of RAB GTPases and their role in growth signaling.",WBPaper00058219,"A novel role for the RAB-6.2 GTPase in regulating LET-23 EGFR-mediated vulva induction, possibly via microRNA regulation.",International Worm Meeting,2019,"Gagnon, S.|Gauthier, K.|Rocheleau, C.E."
"Centrioles are subcellular organelles composed of a ninefold symmetric microtubule array that perform two important functions: (1) They build centrosomes that organize the microtubule cytoskeleton, and (2) they template cilia, microtubule-based projections with sensory and motile functions. We identified HYLS-1, a widely conserved protein, based on its direct interaction with the core centriolar protein SAS-4. HYLS-1 localization to centrioles requires SAS-4 and, like SAS-4, HYLS-1 is stably incorporated into the outer centriole wall. Unlike SAS-4, HYLS-1 is dispensable for centriole assembly and centrosome function in cell division. Instead, HYLS-1 plays an essential role in cilia formation that is conserved between Caenorhabditis elegans and vertebrates. A single amino acid change in human HYLS1 leads to a perinatal lethal disorder termed hydrolethalus syndrome, and we show that this mutation impairs HYLS-1 function in ciliogenesis. HYLS-1 is required for the apical targeting/anchoring of centrioles at the plasma membrane but not for the intraflagellar transport-dependent extension of the ciliary axoneme. These findings classify hydrolethalus syndrome as a severe human ciliopathy and shed light on the dual functionality of centrioles, defining the first stably incorporated centriolar protein that is not required for centriole assembly but instead confers on centrioles the capacity to initiate ciliogenesis.",WBPaper00035062,The hydrolethalus syndrome protein HYLS-1 links core centriole structure to cilia formation.,Genes Dev,2009,Dammermann A|Pemble H|Mitchell BJ|McLeod I|Yates JR|Kintner C|Desai AB|Oegema K
"In Caenorhabditis elegans the Toll-interleukin receptor domain adaptor protein TIR-1 via a conserved mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade induces innate immunity and upregulates serotonin (5-HT) biosynthesis gene tph-1 in a pair of ADF chemosensory neurons in response to infection. Here, we identify transcription factors downstream of the TIR-1 signaling pathway. We show that common transcription factors control the innate immunity and 5-HT biosynthesis. We demonstrate that a cysteine to tyrosine substitution in an ARM motif of the HEAT/Arm repeat region of the TIR-1 protein confers TIR-1 hyperactivation, leading to constitutive tph-1 upregulation in the ADF neurons, increased expression of intestinal antimicrobial genes, and enhanced resistance to killing by the human opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14. A forward genetic screen for suppressors of the hyperactive TIR-1 led to the identification of DAF-19, an ortholog of regulatory factor X (RFX) transcription factors that are required for human adaptive immunity. We show that DAF-19 concerts with ATF-7, a member of the activating transcription factor (ATF)/cAMP response element-binding B (CREB) family of transcription factors, to regulate tph-1 and antimicrobial genes, reminiscent of RFX-CREB interaction in human immune cells. daf-19 mutants display heightened susceptibility to killing by PA14. Remarkably, whereas the TIR-1-MAPK-DAF-19/ATF-7 pathway in the intestinal immunity is regulated by DKF-2/protein kinase D, we found that the regulation of tph-1 expression is independent of DKF-2 but requires UNC-43/Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) II. Our results suggest that pathogenic cues trigger a common core-signaling pathway via tissue-specific mechanisms and demonstrate a novel role for RFX factors in neuronal and innate immune responses to infection.",WBPaper00042139,RFX transcription factor DAF-19 regulates 5-HT and innate immune responses to pathogenic bacteria in Caenorhabditis elegans.,PLoS Genet,2013,Xie Y|Moussaif M|Choi S|Xu L|Sze JY
"Cilia and flagella are structurally highly conserved cellular compartments with motile and/or sensory function. They can be found on many vertebrate cell types as well as on neurons and sperm cells in D. melanogaster and a subset of sensory neurons in C. elegans. In the worm these neurons function mainly in the perception of soluble and volatile compounds, but some of them may also be involved in mechanosensation. DAF-19, the sole RFX-type transcription factor in C. elegans, is strictly required for the formation of cilia. In daf-19 mutants no ciliated endings are formed, leading to a Dyf and strong Daf-c phenotype. daf-19 mutants are to date the only ones showing the extreme phenotype of a complete loss of cilia. All other mutations that affect cilium structure, including mutations in the direct DAF-19 targets osm-1, osm-5, osm-6, xbx-1, che-2 and che-13, result only in a partial truncation of cilia. The exceptional phenotype upon loss of daf-19 expression and the association of DAF-19 target genes with ciliogenesis suggest that DAF-19 governs the transcription of a basic pool of genes required to build a cilium. We speculate that DAF-19 acts very early in the hierarchy of events inducing ciliogenesis and might therefore be regarded as a determination gene for cilium formation. Moreover, expression analyses of several target genes suggest that DAF-19 regulates some of them in a cell type-specific manner and that additional cell type-specific co-regulators exist. To test these suggestions experimentally and to investigate the in vivo functions of DAF-19 in more detail, we are using several approaches. First, we are currently conducting in vivo misexpression studies. The introduction of DAF-19 into usually non-ciliated cells as well as de-regulated expression in sensory neurons should provide more information about the potential of this transcription factor as a determination gene for cilium formation. Furthermore we try to determine the time window during which a developing sensory neuron can become a ciliated neuron. Second, we are employing immunoprecipitation and protein sequencing to identify DAF-19 interacting partners that potentially function in such a regulatory process. Finally, a genetic screen aiming to isolate factors modulating DAF-19 function in a cell-specific way will complement this approach.",WBPaper00019340,The regulation of the RFX transcription factor DAF-19 during ciliogenesis,International Worm Meeting,2003,Gabriele GK Gahmon|Peter Swoboda
"Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is the most common genetic disorder that leads to End-Stage Renal Disease (1).  Mutations in the PKD1 and PKD2 genes account for 95% of all ADPKD cases.  The C. elegans pkd-2 homologue is regulated by DAF-19, an RFX-type transcription factor that binds promoter X-box sequences (imperfect inverted repeat GTHNYYATRRNAAC) (2,3).  It has been found that a tissue-specific isoform of daf-19 specifically regulates lov-1/PKD1, pkd-2, and cwp (coexpressed with polycystin) (4) gene expression without affecting ciliogenesis (see abstract by Wang and Barr).  However, the lack of an X-box in the ADPKD and cwp genes suggests the existence of a transcription factor (or factors) that acts downstream of DAF-19.

To identify direct transcriptional regulators of pkd-2, we used the yeast one-hybrid system with the pkd-2 promoter as bait to screen a mini-TF C. elegans library (5) and a male-enriched cDNA library (6).  Several PBP (pkd-2 promoter binding protein) candidates have been identified.  PBP-1 is a transcription factor with an X-box in its promoter that is conserved between C. elegans and C. briggsae, indicating PBP-1 may be a direct target of DAF-19.  Furthermore, we have identified a potential binding site for this candidate in the pkd-2 promoter; this motif is necessary for pkd-2 expression.
Interestingly, pbp-1 encodes a product with similarity to a human centromere protein required for the mitotic transition from metaphase to anaphase.  This indicates a possible function of pbp-1 in the temporal regulation of pkd-2 and other ADPKD genes in C. elegans.  We will characterize the pbp-1 gene and subsequently evaluate the remaining candidates for further regulatory roles.",WBPaper00028192,Identifying Transcriptional Regulators of ADPKD Genes in C. elegans.,"Neuronal Development, Synaptic Function, and Behavior Meeting",2006,Joseph Wolfe|Juan Wang|Maureen Barr
"Sensory organs are often composed of neuronal sensory endings accommodated in a lumen formed by ensheathing epithelia or glia. Here we show that lumen formation in the C. elegans amphid sensory organ requires the gene daf-6. daf-6 encodes a Patched-related protein that localizes to the luminal surfaces of the amphid channel and other C. elegans tubes. While daf-6 mutants display only amphid lumen defects, animals defective for both daf-6 and the Dispatched gene che-14 exhibit defects in all tubular structures that express daf-6. Furthermore, DAF-6 protein is mislocalized, and lumen morphogenesis is abnormal, in mutants with defective sensory neuron endings. We propose that amphid lumen morphogenesis is coordinated by neuron-derived cues and a DAF-6/CHE-14 system that regulates vesicle dynamics during tubulogenesis.",WBPaper00025237,C. elegans daf-6 encodes a patched-related protein required for lumen formation.,Dev Cell,2005,Perens EA|Shaham S
"Transcription factors (TFs) play a central role in controlling spatiotemporal gene expression and the response to environmental cues. A comprehensive understanding of gene regulation requires integrating physical protein-DNA interactions (PDIs) with TF regulatory activity, expression patterns, and phenotypic data. Although great progress has been made in mapping PDIs using chromatin immunoprecipitation, these studies have only characterized ~10% of TFs in any metazoan species. The nematode C.elegans has been widely used to study gene regulation due to its compact genome with short regulatory sequences. Here, we delineated the largest gene-centered metazoan PDI network to date by examining interactions between 90% of C. elegans TFs and 15% of gene promoters.

"A chemically defined axenic medium, C. elegans maintenance medium (CeMM), has been established for culturing of C. elegans (Lu & Goetsch, 1993). Worms grown on CeMM plates take longer to develop and exhibit a prolonged reproductive period with a decreased brood size (Szewczyk et al., 2006). For N2 animals, about 10% of them develop into adults at day 8 after hatching, whereas the others develop into adults within the following 10 days. Compared to the lab-bred N2 strain, CB4856, a wild Hawaiian strain, takes greater than 16 days to reach adults. We are interested in determining genetic and molecular basis of developmental evolution that promotes animal cells to adapt to alternative nutritional environments. By screening known mutants which are possibly involved in feeding and growth, we observed that hermaphrodites contain mutations in fat-3, lev-11, ser-7, tph-1 and unc-73 grow much faster than N2 worms in CeMM (30-80% mutants reach adults between 5 and 7 days), while daf-2, daf-19, che-2, mdt-15, osm-9, unc-26, unc-32 and unc-42 mutants grow much slower or developmentally arrest in L1 (the majority could not develop into adults by two weeks). Through screening for EMS generated N2 mutant hermaphrodites that grow faster in CeMM, we identified the rg1402, rg1003 and rg804 alleles, which cause 90%, 90% and 75% of the worms to develop into adults on the synthetic medium by day 5, respectively. In addition, we have screened another 10 alleles which could develop to adults between day 5 and 6. Two alleles which cause the worms develop into adults at day 4 were identified through EMS mutagenesis of rg1003. We will serially select and then EMS-mutate hermaphrodites to gradually breed lines that become more adapted and fit for growth in CeMM. Outcrossing experiments demonstrated that enhanced adaptation to CeMM caused by rg1402, rg1003 and rg804 are inherited as a single-locus recessive trait. We are using classical mapping together with whole genome sequence of rg1003 to determine the molecular identity of the recessive allele. The characterization of the fast growth mutants in CeMM will greatly facilitate to systematically analyze the profound impact of nutrition on animal physiology, energy homeostasis and metabolism diseases.

"The relationship between oxidative stress and longevity is a matter of concern in various organisms. We isolated mutants resistant to paraquat from nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. One mutant named mev-4 was long-lived and showed cross-resistance to heat and Dyf phenotype (defective in dye filling). Genetic and sequence analysis revealed that mev-4 had a nonsense mutation on the che-11 gene, homologues of which are involved in formation of cilia and flagella in other organisms. The paraquat resistance was commonly observed in various Dyf mutants and did not depend on the daf-16 gene, whereas the extension of life span did depend on it. Expression of antioxidant enzyme genes seemed normal.

"Mutations affecting dauer larva formation result in one of two phenotypes: dauer defective (Daf-d) or dauer constitutive (Daf-c). Daf-d mutants do not form dauers under dauer-inducing conditions, whereas Daf-c mutants form dauers under non-inducing conditions. Ciliated sensory neurons in the amphids mediate the response to these environmental conditions. Mutations that affect the morphology of these ciliated sensory endings are usually Daf-d. daf-19 mutants are the exception: they completely lack ciliated endings and are Daf-c. All three alleles of daf-19 (m86, sa190, sa232) are strongly Daf-c: ca. 70% or more dauer larvae at 15C, ca. 95% or more at 25C (dauer formation is an inherently temperature sensitive process). The unusual combination of phenotypes could be due to a cell fate specification defect during amphid neuron development. Killing the amphid neurons ADF, ASI and ASG causes a Daf-c phenotype, suggesting that impaired development of amphid neurons can trigger dauer formation. By analysis of daf-d; daf-19 double mutants, we have positioned daf-19 in the formal genetic pathway for dauer formation. daf-19 lies downstream of genes in the two parallel branches of this pathway and upstream of the Daf-d gene daf-12. The genes in the parallel branches are thought to be important for sensory response leading to dauer formation, whereas the genes downsteam and including daf-12 are thought to be important for the reception of amphid neuronal signals by target tissues and for the activation of dauer larva morphogenesis. A possible interpretation of daf-19 epistasis is that daf-19 affects development of the amphid neurons. Germline transformation rescue experiments demonstrated that two overlapping cosmid clones, ZK945 and F27E5, individually rescue daf-19 phenotypes. Subsequent rescue by various subclones from the 9 kbp overlap region revealed that daf-19 is the same as the gene F27E5.5 (predicted by the C. elegans genome project). Database searches and comparisons showed that this gene encodes a novel protein with putative transmembrane domains as well as weak similarities to human melanocortin peptide hormone receptors. Melanocortins have diverse functions and are implicated in nerve cell growth during development and regeneration after damage. Taken together the results suggest that daf-19 might encode a protein involved in cell specification or morphogenesis of amphid sensory neurons. Mutations in the daf-19 gene may thus interfere with the normal dauer formation signalling by causing misspecification of these cells.",WBPaper00011721,daf-19 controls sensory neuron development in C. elegans,European Worm Meeting,1996,Swoboda P|Hankins EG|Adler HT|Thomas JH
"In animals, RFX transcription factors govern ciliogenesis by binding to an X-box motif in the promoters of ciliogenic genes. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the sole RFX transcription factor (TF) daf-19 null mutant lacks all sensory cilia, fails to express many ciliogenic genes, and is defective in many sensory behaviors, including male mating. The daf-19c isoform is expressed in all ciliated sensory neurons and is necessary and sufficient for activating X-box containing ciliogenesis genes. Here, we describe the daf-19(n4132) mutant that is defective in expression of the sensory polycystic kidney disease (PKD) gene battery and male mating behavior, without affecting expression of ciliogenic genes or ciliogenesis. daf-19(n4132) disrupts expression of a new isoform, daf-19m (for function in male mating). daf-19m is expressed in male-specific PKD and core IL2 neurons via internal promoters and remote enhancer elements located in introns of the daf-19 genomic locus. daf-19m genetically programs the sensory functions of a subset of ciliated neurons, independent of daf-19c. In the male-specific HOB neuron, DAF-19(M) acts downstream of the zinc finger TF EGL-46, indicating that a TF cascade controls the PKD gene battery in this cell-type specific context. We conclude that the RFX TF DAF-19 regulates ciliogenesis via X-box containing ciliogenic genes and controls ciliary specialization by regulating non-X-box containing sensory genes.

"Cilia are an important cellular differentiation of sensory neurons for receiving information from the environment. For example in C. elegans, ciliated sensory neurons in the amphid sensilla mediate responses to environmental conditions. Mutations that affect the morphology of ciliated endings of these sensory neurons usually cause diverse phenotypes such as defective chemo- and mechanosensation. They also affect the decision of whether or not to form a dauer (diapause) larva. These mutations identify genes required for proper neuronal differentiation and cilia formation. daf-19 mutants (daf = dauer formation affected) completely lack sensory cilia. This was shown by electron microscopy (serial sections through the head of the worm) and by analysis of transgenic animals expressing GFP in the amphid neuron ASE in daf-19 mutants. Aside from the absence of cilia, the neurons seemed to be morphologically normal. The amphid neuron AFD (which has only a rudimentary cilium) was apparently normal in daf-19 mutants. We cloned daf-19. It encodes an RFX-type transcription factor. So far this class of proteins has been found in humans, mice and yeast. From work with mammalian cell cultures the RFX-binding sites (X-boxes) for some members of the family are known. By searching the C. elegans genome database we found DNA-sequences that fit the X-box consensus in the promoter regions of genes known to be expressed or to function in ciliated sensory neurons. As a first step toward testing whether daf-19 transcriptionally regulates these genes in vivo we fused three different promoters to GFP (che-2, osm-1, osm-6; containing either wild-type or mutated X-box sequences, respectively). In the wild-type situation all three promoters drove GFP expression in ciliated sensory neurons in the head and in the tail of the animal. When the X-box sequences were mutated in all three promoters, GFP expression was drastically curtailed or absent in all of these neurons. So far our results strongly suggest that DAF-19 controls the transcription of a battery of genes whose products form the sensory cilium or function therein.",WBPaper00011836,daf-19 REGULATES THE FORMATION OF CILIATED ENDINGS OF SENSORY NEURONS IN C.

We demonstrate that male vulva location behavior and expression of lov-1 and pkd-2 in the ciliated sensory neuron HOB require the activities of transcription factor EGL-46 and to some extent also EGL-44. This EGL-46-regulated program is specific to HOB and is distinct from a general ciliogenic pathway functioning in all ciliated neurons.

The remainder of the amphid neuron appeared normal. In the amphid neuron AFD the fingers (they are not ciliated endings) seemed to be wild-type in a daf-19 background. Taken together, these results suggest that daf-19 is involved in cell specification or morphogenesis of amphid sensory neurons or their ciliated endings.

"RFX transcription factors play an evolutionarily conserved role in ciliogenesis. In Caenorhabditis elegans, DAF-19 is the sole RFX transcription factor that regulates cilia development via activation of ciliogenic genes containing X-box promoter elements (Swoboda et al 2000). Here we identify a novel isoform of daf-19, daf-19, (for its function in mating behavior) that is essential for male-specific sensory gene expression, thereby patterning several aspects of adult male sexual behaviors. The ciliogenic isoforms of daf-19 are expressed in the core and male-specific ciliated nervous system, comprised of 60 and 48 cells, respectively. In contrast, daf-19 is expressed in only 6 core and 21 male-specific ciliated sensory B-type neurons. The latter express the ADPKD gene battery, which do not have X-box containing promoters and include lov-1/PKD1, pkd-2, the kinesin-3 klp-6, and the co-expressed with polycystin (cwp) genes. The former, the IL2s, also express klp-6 and a subset of the cwps, and are the few remaining C. elegans neurons of unknown function. daf-19 is essential for ADPKD gene expression and sensory function in the adult male, without affecting ciliogenesis. A secondary promoter and a distal upstream enhancer coordinate daf-19 sensory-specification functions in tail HOB and RnB neurons and head CEM and IL2 neurons, respectively.

"Cilia are complex organelles involved in sensory perception and motility with intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins being essential for cilia assembly and function, but little is known about cilia in an evo-devo context. For example, recent comparisons revealed conservation and divergence of IFT components in the regulation of social feeding behaviors between the nematodes Caenorhabditis elegans and Pristionchus pacificus. Here, we focus on the P. pacificus RFX transcription factor daf-19, the master regulator of ciliogenesis in C. elegans. Two CRISPR/Cas9-induced Ppa-daf-19 mutants lack ciliary structures in amphid neurons and display chemosensory defects. In contrast to IFT mutants, Ppa-daf-19 mutants do not exhibit social behavior. However, they show weak locomotive responses to shifts in oxygen concentration, suggesting partial impairment in sensing or responding to oxygen. To identify targets of Ppa-daf-19 regulation we compared the transcriptomes of Ppa-daf-19 and wild-type animals and performed a bioinformatic search for the X-box RFX binding-site across the genome. The regulatory network of Ppa-DAF-19 involves IFT genes but also many taxonomically restricted genes. We identified a conserved X-box motif as the putative binding site, which was validated for the Ppa-dyf-1 gene. Thus, Ppa-DAF-19 controls ciliogenesis, influences oxygen-induced behaviors and displays a high turnover of its regulatory network.",WBPaper00055311,DAF-19/RFX controls ciliogenesis and influences oxygen-induced social behaviors in Pristionchus pacificus.,Evol Dev,2018,Moreno E|Lenuzzi M|ROdelsperger C|Prabh N|Witte H|Roeseler W|Riebesell M|Sommer RJ
"OrthoList, a compendium of <i>Caenorhabditis</i><i>elegans</i> genes with human orthologs compiled in 2011 by a meta-analysis of four orthology-prediction methods, has been a popular tool for identifying conserved genes for research into biological and disease mechanisms. However, the efficacy of orthology prediction depends on the accuracy of gene model predictions, an ongoing process, and orthology-prediction algorithms have also been updated over time. Here we present OrthoList 2 (OL2), a new comparative genomic analysis between <i>C. elegans</i> and humans, and the first assessment of how changes over time affect the landscape of predicted orthologs between two species. Although we find that updates to the orthology-prediction methods significantly changed the landscape of <i>C. elegans-</i>human orthologs predicted by individual programs, and, unexpectedly, reduced agreement amongst them, we also show that our meta-analysis approach &quot;buffered&quot; against changes in gene content. We show that adding results from more programs did not lead to many additions to the list, and discuss reasons to avoid assigning &quot;scores&quot; based on support by individual orthology prediction programs, the treatment of &quot;legacy&quot; genes no longer predicted by these programs, and the practical difficulties of updating due to encountering deprecated, changed, or retired gene IDs. In addition, we consider what other criteria may support claims of orthology, and alternative approaches to find potential orthologs that elude identification by these programs. Finally, we created a new web-based tool that allows for rapid searches of OL2 by gene identifiers, protein domains (InterPro and SMART), or human-disease associations (OMIM), and also includes available RNAi resources to facilitate potential translational cross-species studies.",WBPaper00055090,OrthoList 2: A New Comparative Genomic Analysis of Human and <i>Caenorhabditis</i><i>elegans</i> Genes.,Genetics,2018,Kim W|Underwood RS|Greenwald I|Shaye DD
"Caenorhabditis elegans, a small free-living soil nematode, is an ideal organism for the genetic dissection of simple behaviors. Over 150 genes required for normal behavior have been identified. We review here the neural and genetic pathways underlying four of the best-studied C. elegans behaviors: locomotion, response to gentle touch, egg-laying, and chemotaxis. Mutations affecting these behaviors have identified genes which specify neuronal cell lineage, neuronal cell fate, and the formation of cell matrix cues involved in axonal guidance. Molecular analysis of genes required for normal behavior offers the prospect of characterizing functionally important nervous system proteins, regardless of their abundance or biochemical role.",WBPaper00001296,The behavioral genetics of Caenorhabditis elegans.,Behav Genet,1990,Wolinsky EJ|Way JC
"Mutations interfering with dauer larva formation can be subdivided into two classes: dauer defective (Daf-d) and dauer constitutive (Daf-c). Daf-d animals do not form dauers under dauer-inducing conditions, whereas Daf-c animals form dauers under non-inducing conditions. Ciliated sensory neurons in the amphids have been shown to be involved in the response to these environmental conditions. Mutant animals with morphological defects in these ciliated sensory endings are usually Daf-d. The exception to this rule is daf-19. daf-19 mutant animals completely lack ciliated endings and are Daf-c. We hypothesize that these unusual phenotypes are due to a cell fate specification defect during amphid neuron development. As shown by the fact that killing the amphid neurons ADF, ASI and ASG causes a Daf-c phenotype, impaired development of neurons may trigger responding cells to execute the dauer formation program inappropriately. The existance of three alleles (m86, sa190, sa232) shows that these unusual phenotypes of daf-19 are due to mutations in one gene. We are studying the defects caused by mutations of daf-19 using two approaches. (i) Preliminary genetic analyses suggest that daf-19 is epistatic to all Daf-d genes except for daf-12. This might suggest a fundamental role of the daf-19 gene product in neuronal cells important for dauer formation. (ii) The position of the daf-19 gene on the genetic and physical maps has been determined. Germline transformation experiments identified overlapping cosmids that rescued the daf-19 mutant phenotypes. These data are in the process of being confirmed and extended in order to clone daf-19.",WBPaper00022085,DO daf-19 MUTATIONS CAUSE DEFECTS IN AMPHID NEURON SPECIFICATION?,International C. elegans Meeting,1995,Swoboda P|Hankins EG|Adler HT|Thomas JH
"Amphid neurons can access the outside environment by extending cilia through a lumen formed by sheath and socket glia. Lumen formation in the amphid requires daf-6, which encodes a Patched-related protein. DAF-6 protein localizes to vesicles and to luminal surfaces in the amphid sheath and socket glia, as well as in other tubes in the worm. The luminal localization of DAF-6 suggested that neuronal cilia in the amphid lumen might regulate DAF-6 localization or function. To test this idea, we examined the amphid lumens of mutants with defective cilia. We observed several defects. First, as in daf-6 mutants, daf-19 mutants, which lack cilia, accumulated vacuoles in the sheath glia. Second, DAF-6::GFP in the amphid localized only to a punctate structure in the cilia defective mutants che-3, che-11, che-13, daf-10, daf-19, and osm-6. Finally, while previous EM analysis revealed no gross channel defects in these mutants (Perkins et al., 1986), our EM analysis of daf-19 animals did reveal defects: the sheath channel lumen was irregular in shape, with branching outpockets, and the distance from the anterior end of the dendrite to the anterior end of the sheath glia lumen was reduced. Thus, altered DAF-6 localization in cilia-defective mutants may lead to channel alterations. To define regions important for DAF-6 function and subcellular localization, we generated mutant versions of a DAF-6::GFP rescuing protein. Patched proteins share sequence features with some prokaryotic permeases. Mutating the conserved permease motif did not eliminate function or alter localization, suggesting that DAF-6 is not likely to function as a permease. DAF-6 also contains a conserved five-transmembrane sterol-sensing domain (SSD) suggested to regulate protein localization. Function and localization, however, were largely unaffected in SSD mutant DAF-6 proteins. Also, the DAF-6 SSD alone was not sufficient to confer appropriate DAF-6 function or subcellular localization. Finally, DAF-6 has two predicted extracellular loops. Deletion of the second extracellular loop abolished both DAF-6 function and localization. Function was also abolished by a missense mutation in the first loop; surprisingly, however, subcellular localization of DAF-6::GFP was not disrupted by this mutation, suggesting that proper DAF-6 localization is not sufficient for DAF-6 function, and that DAF-6 activity may be regulated by interaction with other proteins making contact with the first extracellular loop. One possible model consistent with our results is that DAF-6 responds to a neuronally generated signal to coordinate tube morphogenesis.",WBPaper00026184,Communication between neuronal cilia and sheath glia may regulate channel dimensions in the C. elegans amphid,International Worm Meeting,2005,Elliot A Perens|Shai Shaham
"Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized primarily by retinal dystrophy, obesity, polydactyly, renal malformations and learning disabilities. Although five BBS genes have been cloned, the molecular basis of this syndrome remains elusive. Here we show that BBS is probably caused by a defect at the basal body of ciliated cells. We have cloned a new BBS gene, BBS8, which encodes a protein with a prokaryotic domain, pilF, involved in pilus formation and twitching mobility. In one family, a homozygous null BBS8 mutation leads to BBS with randomization of left-right body axis symmetry, a known defect of the nodal cilium. We have also found that BBS8 localizes specifically to ciliated structures, such as the connecting cilium of the retina and columnar epithelial cells in the lung. In cells, BBS8 localizes to centrosomes and basal bodies and interacts with PCM1, a protein probably involved in ciliogenesis. Finally, we demonstrate that all available Caenorhabditis elegans BBS homologues are expressed exclusively in ciliated neurons, and contain regulatory elements for RFX, a transcription factor that modulates the expression of genes associated with ciliogenesis and intraflagellar transport.",WBPaper00024175,Basal body dysfunction is a likely cause of pleiotropic Bardet-Biedl syndrome.,Nature,2003,Ansley SJ|Badano JL|Blacque OE|Hill J|Hoskins BE|Leitch CC|Kim JC|Ross AJ|Eichers ER|Teslovich TM|Mah AK|Johnsen RC|Cavender JC|Lewis RA|Leroux MR|Beales PL|Katsanis N
"Cilia on dendritic endings of sensory neurons organize distinct types of sensory machinery [1]. Ciliated endings display neuron-type-specific patterns of membrane elaborations [1-3], but it is not well understood how such neuron-type-specific morphologies are generated and whether they are coupled to the specification of other identity aspects of a terminally differentiated sensory neuron. In the course of a genome-wide analysis of members of a small family of immunoglobulin domain proteins, we found that OIG-8, a previously uncharacterized transmembrane protein with a single immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, instructs the distinct, neuron-type-specific elaboration of ciliated endings of different olfactory neuron types in the nematode C.elegans. OIG-8 protein localizes to ciliated endings of these sensory neurons, and is transcribed at different levels in distinct olfactory neuron types. oig-8 expression levels correlate with the extent of sensory cilia growth and branching patterns. Loss of oig-8 leads to a reduction in the branching patterns of cilia, whereas raising the levels of oig-8 results in an increase in elaborations. Levels of OIG-8 expression are controlled by the specific combination of a terminal selector type of transcription factorsthat also specify other identity features of distinct olfactory neuron types.",WBPaper00051345,Morphological Diversity of C.elegans Sensory Cilia Instructed by the Differential Expression of an Immunoglobulin Domain Protein.,Curr Biol,2017,Howell K|Hobert O
"Gabriele Gahmon and Peter Swoboda. DAF-19 is an RFX-transcription factor (Regulatory Factor binding to the X-box), which has been shown to be essential for the development of cilia on 60 sensory neurons in C. elegans. Mutations in daf-19 lead to the complete loss of all ciliated structures, but leave the cell bodies and neurites of these neurons intact. DAF-19 has been shown to regulate a large number of cilium-specific genes encoding structural and functional cilium components as well as other transcription factors. This finding suggests a very central role of DAF-19 during ciliogenesis. Since DAF-19 is essential for the formation of cilia, we hypothesize that it could also be sufficient. We try to answer this question by expressing the daf-19 gene from heterologous promoters in cells that usually do not carry cilia with the aim of inducing ectopic cilia. When expressed in tail hypodermis cells, daf-19 leads to morphological changes of the hermaphrodite tail and to the ectopic expression of direct DAF-19 target genes. Several of these cells do not show hypodermal cell characteristics anymore, but display more neuron-like features (e.g. processes). Currently we are characterizing in detail to what extent the ectopic expression of daf-19 can transform hypodermis cells into neuronal or even cilium-carrying cells.",WBPaper00027508,"Ectopic Expression of DAF-19, a Transcription Factor that Controls Cilium Development",European Worm Meeting,2006,Gabriele Gahmon|Peter Swoboda
"Cilia are present on cells of many eukaryotic organisms and recent data in the mouse suggest that ciliary defects can cause severe developmental abnormalities and disease. Studies across eukaryotic systems indicate that cilia are constructed and maintained through a highly conserved process termed intraflagellar transport (IFT), for which many of the proteins involved have yet to be identified. 11717 describes the movement of large protein particles consisting of an A and a B complex along the cilia axoneme in anterograde and retrograde directions. Herein we describe a novel C. elegans gene, F59C6.7/9, that is required for cilia assembly and whose function is disrupted in che-13 ciliogenic mutants. As previously shown for all IFT complex B genes identified to date, expression of che-13 (F59C6.7/9) is regulated by the RFX-type transcription factor DAF-19, suggesting a conserved transcriptional pathway in ciliogenesis. Fluorescent-tagged CHE-13 protein concentrates at the base of cilia and moves along the axoneme as expected for an IFT protein. Furthermore, loss of che-13 differentially affects the localization of two known IFT complex B proteins, OSM-5 and OSM-6, implying that CHE-13 functions as part of this complex. Overall, our data confirm that CHE-13 is an IFT protein and further that the IFT particle assembles in an ordered process through specific protein-protein",WBPaper00005786,"Identification of CHE-13, a novel intraflagellar transport protein required for cilia formation.",Exp Cell Res,2003,Haycraft CJ|Schafer JC|Zhang Q|Taulman PD|Yoder BK
"Dauer larva can survive for long periods in harsh environments. Some of the daf genes that control dauer formation are expected to be involved in the acquisition of resistance to severe stress and extention of life span. We are interested in oxidative stress because oxidative stress is postulated to be one of the causative agents in aging. In order to clarify the mechanism of acquisition of stress resistance and extension of life span, the susceptibility to oxidative stress has been measured in various daf mutants and their double and triple mutants. In ts mutants, measurements were done at non-permissive temperatures after the L4 stage. daf-1 mutant, daf-3, daf-4, daf-5, daf-6, daf-7, daf-8, daf-10, daf-12, daf-13, daf-14, daf-16, daf-18, daf-19 and daf-22 are similar to wild type N2 with respect to susceptibility to oxidative stress. daf-2(e1370) and daf-2(e1286) are more resistant to oxidative stress than N2. On the other hand daf-2(m41) and daf-2(e1368) were similar to N2. daf-23(m333) are more resistant to oxidative stress than N2. daf-2(e1370); daf-3(e1376) double mutant and daf-5(e1386); daf-2 (e1370) are similar to daf-2(e1370). daf-16(m26); daf-2(e1370) and daf-18(e1375); daf-2(e1370) are similar to N2. daf-2(e1370); daf-12(m20) is somewhat more resistant than daf-2 (e1370). daf-16(m26); daf-2(e1370); daf-12(m20) triple mutant is similar to N2. daf-16(m26); daf-23(m333) is similar to N2. daf-18(e1375); daf-23 (m333) is intermediate between daf-18 and daf-23 . We have measured the adult life span of long-life mutants: daf-2 and daf-2; daf-12 under hyperoxia. N2 life span under hyperoxia was about 70% of that under an air atmosphere. By contrast, the life span of daf-2(e1370) under hyperoxia was about 90% of that under air atmosphere, and the life span of daf-2(e1370); daf-12(m20) was almost the same as that under air atmosphere, indicating correlation between oxidative-stress resistance and longevity. These results indicate that the characteristic genetic pathway involved in acquiring oxidative-stress tolerance is similar to that involved in determining longevity (Larsen et al., '95). daf-12 | daf-2 - daf-18 - daf-23 - daf-16 - (oxidative-stress resistance) References: S.Honda et al., Mech.

"In humans, mutations of a growing list of regulatory factor X (RFX) target genes have been associated with devastating genetics disease conditions including ciliopathies. However, mechanisms underlying RFX transcription factors (TFs)-mediated gene expression regulation, especially differential gene expression regulation, are largely unknown. In this study, we explore the functional significance of the co-existence of multiple X-box motifs in regulating differential gene expression in Caenorhabditis elegans. We hypothesize that the effect of multiple X-box motifs is not a simple summation of binding effect to individual X-box motifs located within a same gene. To test this hypothesis, we identified eight C. elegans genes that contain two or more X-box motifs using comparative genomics. We examined one of these genes, F25B4.2, which contains two 15-bp X-box motifs. F25B4.2 expression in ciliated neurons is driven by the proximal motif and its expression is repressed by the distal motif. Our data suggest that two X-box motifs cooperate together to regulate the expression of F25B4.2 in location and intensity. We propose that multiple X-box motifs might be required to tune specific expression level. Our identification of genes with multiple X-box motifs will also improve our understanding of RFX/DAF-19-mediated regulation in C. elegans and in other organisms including humans.",WBPaper00040183,Fine tuning of RFX/DAF-19-regulated target gene expression through binding to multiple sites in Caenorhabditis elegans.,Nucleic Acids Res,2012,Chu JS|Tarailo-Graovac M|Zhang D|Wang J|Uyar B|Tu D|Trinh J|Baillie DL|Chen N
"Many types of sensory neurons contain modified cilia where sensory signal transduction occurs. We report that the C. elegans gene daf-19 encodes an RFX-type transcription factor that is expressed specifically in all ciliated sensory neurons. Loss of daf-19 function causes the absence of cilia, resulting in severe sensory defects. Several genes that function in all ciliated sensory neurons have an RFX target site in their promoters and require daf-19 function. Several other genes that function in subsets of ciliated sensory neurons do not have an RFX target site and are not daf-19 dependent. These results suggest that expression of the shared components of sensory cilia is activated by daf-19, whereas cell-type-specific expression occurs independently of daf-19.",WBPaper00003977,The RFX-type transcription factor DAF-19 regulates sensory neuron cilium formation in C. elegans.,Mol Cell,2000,Swoboda P|Adler HT|Thomas JH
"Cilia and flagella play roles in many physiological processes, including cell and fluid motility, sensory perception and development. The biogenesis and maintenance of cilia is driven by a conserved process termed intraflagellar transport (IFT), which uses kinesin and dynein to move particles and cargo bidirectionally along the microtubule axoneme. Defects in IFT and more generally, cilia function, are associated with several human ailments. These include cystic kidneys, retinal degeneration, and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), which is further characterized by obesity, diabetes and an abrogated sense of smell and hearing. 

To uncover novel ciliary genes that are required for cilia biogenesis/function, and may be implicated in human disease, we took several complementary approaches with C. elegans. The studies include (i) comparison of the expression profiles of ciliated cells versus non-ciliated cells, (ii) bioinformatic identification of genes regulated by the ciliogenic transcription factor DAF-19, (iii) identification of DAF-19 target genes by microarray analysis comparisons of wild-type and daf-19 mutant strains, and (iv) screening for mutants with abrogated cilia function (e.g., dyf, or dye-filling defective). We then carry out three types of studies to validate if the candidate genes identified possess roles in cilia biogenesis or function. The first is to assess if their expression is enriched in ciliated sensory neurons, a sign that they may serve cilia-specific functions. The second is to analyse by time-lapse microscopy the (potentially dynamic) subcellular localisation of the encoded proteins to see, for example, if they encode ciliary/IFT components. Lastly, we seek to analyse the corresponding mutant strains for ciliary defects and behavioural (e.g., sensory) phenotypes.

Our studies have led to the identification of many novel putative ciliary genes, and we have gathered evidence for ciliary functions for several of these. Two basic classes of ciliary genes appear to exist, namely those that are required for the formation of cilia, and others that likely play specific roles in the sensory functions of cilia or in the differentiation of the various ciliated sensory neuron types. The ultimate aim of these studies is to identify all of the components required for cilia biogenesis, as well as to uncover new ciliary proteins associated with human diseases, and to define the components and molecular pathways used by cilia for its sensory functions.",WBPaper00028100,Identification of genes linked to cilia function and human disorders,"Neuronal Development, Synaptic Function, and Behavior Meeting",2006,Oliver Blacque|Michel Leroux

"At the core of the primary transcriptional network regulating ciliary gene expression in Caenorhabditis elegans sensory neurons is the RFX/DAF-19 transcription factor, which binds and thereby positively regulates 13-15 bp X-box promoter motifs found in the cis-regulatory regions of many ciliary genes. However, the variable expression of direct RFX-target genes in various sets of ciliated sensory neurons (CSNs) occurs through as of yet uncharacterized mechanisms. In this study the cis-regulatory regions of 41 direct RFX-target genes are compared using in vivo genetic analyses and computational comparisons of orthologous nematode sequences. We find that neither the proximity to the translational start site nor the exact sequence composition of the X-box promoter motif of the respective ciliary gene can explain the variation in expression patterns observed among different direct RFX-target genes. Instead, a novel enhancer element appears to co-regulate ciliary genes in a DAF-19 dependent manner. This cytosine- and thymidine-rich sequence, the C-box, was found in the cis-regulatory regions in close proximity to the respective X-box motif for 84% of the most broadly expressed direct RFX-target genes sampled in this study. Molecular characterization confirmed that these 8-11 bp C-box sequences act as strong enhancer elements for direct RFX-target genes. An artificial promoter containing only an X-box promoter motif and two of the C-box enhancer elements was able to drive strong expression of a GFP reporter construct in many C. elegans CSNs. These data provide a much-improved understanding of how direct RFX-target genes are differentially regulated in C. elegans and will provide a molecular model for uncovering the transcriptional network mediating ciliary gene expression in animals.",WBPaper00041177,"The in vivo dissection of direct RFX-target gene promoters in C. elegans reveals a novel cis-regulatory element, the C-box.",Dev Biol,2012,Burghoorn J|Piasecki BP|Crona F|Phirke P|Jeppsson KE|Swoboda P
"Regulatory factor X (RFX) transcription factors are distributed and play important roles in eukaryotes. In mammals, there are five members of the RFX transcription factor family controlling a diversity of biological processes. For example RFX5 regulates major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) gene expression while RFX3 regulates nodal cilium development. In Caenorhabditis elegans, daf-19 encodes the sole RFX transcription factor [1]. daf-19 mutants lack all sensory cilia and exhibit severe sensory defects. daf-19 regulates ciliogenesis by binding to an X-box motif in the promoter of xbx genes [2]. daf-19 mutants do not express the autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) gene homolog pkd-2, although an X-box is lacking in the pkd-2 promoter [3]. How DAF-19 regulates both ciliogenesis and ciliated neuron differentiation and function is unknown. Here, we describe the characterization of a new allele of daf-19, n4132 [4], that specifically affects sensory neuron function but not ciliogenesis. We find that the daf-19 locus encodes multiple isoforms including one that is expressed in a subset of ciliated neurons including the polycystin-expressing male-specific CEM, HOB, and RnB (not R6B) sensory neurons. Expression of this daf-19 isoform depends on at least two separate enhancers, an RnB and HOB enhancer deleted in the n4132 mutant and a CEM enhancer. The function of the CEM enhancer is dependent on the RnB and HOB enhancer. We propose that DAF-19 is a positive regulator of lov-1, pkd-2, and genes involved in male sensory neuron function and polycystin signaling. Targets of this PKD gene specific isoform of DAF-19 present new sensory components required for C. elegans male mating behavior as well as potential points of therapeutic intervention in ADPKD. 1.

"Cilia are widespread eukaryotic subcellular organelles that function in cell motility, movement of extracellular fluids and sensory reception. While structure and function of cilia are well known, there are many questions with regard to cilia formation and development. The gene daf-19, encoding an RFX-family transcription factor, is crucial for the formation of cilia of sensory neurons. DAF-19 regulates the activity of its target genes by binding to the x-box promoter motif. The C. elegans genome has more than 200 candidate x-box genes. We have initiated expression analysis of these candidate genes. Our results suggest that only genes with x-boxes of a certain nucleotide composition will be expressed in most or all ciliated neurons. Using this consensus sequence we have identified new genes such as the dynein-complex gene xbx-1 that is involved in retrograde cilium transport, and genes D1009.5 and F20D12.3 that are also thought to be very important for cilium structure and function. The roles of new cilium genes are being determined by using RNAi, by generating knockouts and by interaction screens with already known cilium components. Based on the data obtained so far we conclude that DAF-19 typically regulates genes for cilium structure and transport machinery, whereas genes for signal reception and transduction do not require its function. Thus, the x-box search strategy represents a powerful tool for discovering new cilium genes in C. elegans. The knowledge of cilium genes and their function is very important for understanding human pathologies that are caused by defects in cilia.",WBPaper00019342,The X-BOX - a major regulatory motif of ciliogenesis in C. elegans,International Worm Meeting,2003,Evgeni Efimenko|Peter Swoboda
"Like any mobile organism, C. elegans relies on sensory cues to find food.  In the absence of such cues, defined search patterns or other stereotypical behaviors may be observed. We are characterizing the movement pattern of C. elegans in the absence of chemotactic stimuli, over time scales comparable to that of starvation.  To this end, we devised a flatbed scanner-based imaging setup that enables us to collect individual animals' trajectories over large (24 cm x 24 cm) Petri dishes.   Surprisingly, the majority (~60%) of wild-type trajectories display persistence in the direction of motion over length scales that are 50-100 times the animal's body length.   A preliminary dataset of trajectories acquired with an independent camera-based imaging setup qualitatively confirmed this result.   Synthetic trajectories generated from the same angle and step distributions of individual trajectories show that persistence of motion cannot be accounted for by a simple random walk model of locomotion.   To determine whether sensory perception is required for the animals' directional behavior, we analyzed the trajectories of animals with impaired sensory function.   We found that animals mutant for either tax-2 or tax-4, which encode subunits of a cGMP-gated channel required for several sensory modalities, do not show directional behavior.   However, daf-19 mutants, which lack all chemosensory and mechanosensory cilia, display wild-type directional behavior, albeit at a lower percentage (~20%).   Targeting thermosensation specifically with a gcy-8; gcy-18; gcy-23 triple mutation fails to suppress directional behavior.

How are signals from the TGFbeta and insulin/IGF pathways integrated? What gene expression programs do these pathways regulate, and how do they control complex downstream events?RESULTS:  We have identified genes that show different levels of expression in a comparison of wild-type L2 or L3 larvae (non-dauer) to TGFbeta mutants at similar developmental stages undergoing dauer formation. Many insulin/IGF pathway and other known dauer regulatory genes have changes in expression that suggest strong positive feedback by the TGFbeta pathway. In addition, many insulin-like ligand and novel genes with similarity to the extracellular domain of insulin/IGF receptors have altered expression. We have identified a large group of regulated genes with putative binding sites for the FOXO transcription factor, DAF-16. Genes with DAF-16 sites upstream of the transcription start site tend to be upregulated, whereas genes with DAF-16 sites downstream of the coding region tend to be downregulated. Finally, we also see strong regulation of many novel hedgehog- and patched-related genes, hormone biosynthetic genes, cell cycle genes, and other regulatory genes.CONCLUSIONS:  The feedback regulation of insulin/IGF pathway and other dauer genes that we observe would be predicted to amplify signals from the TGFbeta pathway; this amplification may serve to ensure a decisive choice between ""dauer"" and ""non-dauer"", even if environmental cues are ambiguous. Up and down regulation of insulin-like ligands and novel genes with similarity to the extracellular domain of insulin/IGF receptors suggests opposing roles for several members of these large gene families. Unlike in adults, most genes with putative DAF-16 binding sites are upregulated during dauer entry, suggesting that DAF-16 has different activity in dauer versus adult metabolism and aging. However, our observation that the position of putative DAF-16 binding sites is correlated with the direction of regulation suggests a novel method of achieving gene-specific regulation from a single pathway. We see evidence of TGFbeta-mediated regulation of several other classes of regulatory genes, and we discuss possible functions of these genes in dauer formation.",WBPaper00024393,Regulation of signaling genes by TGFbeta during entry into dauer diapause in C. elegans.,BMC Dev Biol,2004,Liu T|Zimmerman KK|Patterson GI
"OBJECTIVE: Mitochondrial ""retrograde"" signaling may stimulate organelle biogenesis as a compensatory adaptation to aberrant activity of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. To maintain energy-consuming processes in OXPHOS deficient cells, alternative metabolic pathways are functionally coupled to the degradation, recycling and redistribution of biomolecules across distinct intracellular compartments. While transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial network expansion has been the focus of many studies, the molecular mechanisms promoting mitochondrial maintenance in energy-deprived cells remain poorly investigated. METHODS: We performed transcriptomics, quantitative proteomics and lifespan assays to identify pathways that are mechanistically linked to mitochondrial network expansion and homeostasis in Caenorhabditis elegans lacking the mitochondrial calcium uptake protein 1 (MICU-1/MICU1). To support our findings, we carried out biochemical and image analyses in mammalian cells and mouse-derived tissues. RESULTS: We report that micu-1(null) mutations impair the OXPHOS system and promote C. elegans longevity through a transcriptional program that is independent of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter MCU-1/MCU and the essential MCU regulator EMRE-1/EMRE. We identify sphingosine phosphate lyase SPL-1/SGPL1 and the ATFS-1-target HOPS complex subunit VPS-39/VPS39 as critical lifespan modulators of micu-1(null) mutant animals. Cross-species investigation indicates that SGPL1 upregulation stimulates VPS39 recruitment to the mitochondria, thereby enhancing mitochondria-lysosome contacts. Consistently, VPS39 downregulation compromises mitochondrial network maintenance and basal autophagic flux in MICU1 deficient cells. In mouse-derived muscles, we show that VPS39 recruitment to the mitochondria may represent a common signature associated with altered OXPHOS system. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized SGPL1/VPS39 axis that stimulates intracellular organelle interactions and sustains autophagy and mitochondrial homeostasis in OXPHOS deficient cells.",WBPaper00063976,SGPL1 stimulates VPS39 recruitment to the mitochondria in MICU1 deficient cells.,Mol Metab,2022,Jackson J|Wischhof L|Scifo E|Pellizzer A|Wang Y|Piazzesi A|Gentile D|Siddig S|Stork M|Hopkins CE|Handler K|Weis J|Roos A|Schultze JL|Nicotera P|Ehninger D|Bano D
"In an effort to tag genes that affect dauer larva formation, we have been using mutator strains to screen for spontaneous dauer- constitutive (daf) mutants, which form dauer larvae in the presence of food. The three strains used were TR679, DR842, and RW7097. TR679 has been described by Anderson et al., WBG 9(1): 29. DR842 is an unc-22(+) revertant of RW7080. The latter strain has approximately 70 copies of Tc1 and mutator loci on both LG I (mut-4) and LG II (mut-5). RW7097 contains 50-70 copies of Tc1 and a mutator, mut-6 IV. (Descriptions of RW7080 and RW7097 provided by Ikue Mori and Don Moerman, personal communication.) One worm was placed on each of many large plates at 20 C and the progeny (F2-F3 generations) screened just before the food supply was depleted (1,000 - 3,000 worms per plate). Populations of TR679 had to be screened visually because dauer larvae formed by this strain are SDS-sensitive. DR842 and RW7097 were screened visually and with SDS. We found mutations in three dauer-constitutive genes -- daf-1 IV, daf-24 11 (a new gene), and an X-linked daf that has a phenotype similar to daf-9(e1406). We also saved spontaneous dumpy mutants from visual screening, including three alleles of dpy-13, which are of interest to us because of the close proximity of dpy-13 to ama-1 IV ( see Bird and Riddle, this issue). Twitchers, presumably unc-22, were found quite frequently but not kept. Screens were performed on worms grown at 20 C, because fertility is low at 25 C. In having to select for dauer larvae formed at 20 C, we biased the screen against temperature-sensitive mutants. All three alleles of daf-24 are non- conditional, as is the X-linked daf, and both spontaneous mutant alleles of daf - I form a high percentage of dauer larvae at I 5 C. We have concluded that Tc1 does not insert into dauer-constitutive genes at high frequency (perhaps with the exceptions of daf-1 and daf-24) and that spontaneous mutations in dpy-13 appear to be quite common (at least in DR842 and RW7097). One spontaneous revertant of daf-1 has been found thus far, and three spontaneous intragenic dpy-13 revertants have been found. Hence, these mutants exhibit some properties consistent with transposon insertions. {Figure 1}",WBPaper00016537,spontaneous daf and dpy mutants isolated from mutator strains.,Worm Breeder's Gazette,1986,Albert PS|Riddle DL
"The sensory cilia of C. elegans protrude from sensory neurons. Cilia are sensory organelles crowded with the membrane receptors and signalling machinery detecting external cues. The composition of cilia is tightly regulated by the IntraFlagellar Transport (IFT) machinery. Regulation of traffic in and out of the cilia by IFT is thought to be the main path controlling ciliary receptors.  In our work, we show that packing and disposal of ciliary receptors in extracellular vesicles budding from the cilia (=ectosomes) complement their retrieval by IFT. In-vivo live recordings show ectosomes formed at the cilia base and/or at the cilia tip of a subset of C. elegans sensory neurons. Ectosomes budding from cilia tip are environmentally released, while ectosomes produced from the cilia base are concomitantly phagocytosed by the associated glial cells. We identified 2 proteins of the Tetraspanin family as ciliary ectosome markers to explore ciliary ectosome biogenesis, export and capture by the associated glia. In addition, we show that at least three endogenous ciliary membrane receptors expressed in 2 different neurons are packed in ciliary ectosomes and exported to their associated glial cells.  Mutations in the BBSome (bbs-8) and cilia dynein motor (che-3) genes, responsible for IFT retrieval of ciliary receptors, increase the export of the salt-sensing receptor GCY-22 from ASER neurons via ectosomes, preventing GCY-22 accumulation in ASER cilia. Surprisingly, the daf-19 ciliogenesis mutant, which results in absence of cilia but does not prevent trafficking of GCY-22 to the distal dendrite, still packs and exports GCY-22 in ectosomes budding from ASER distal dendrite. We conclude that local accumulation of GCY-22 by cell trafficking -rather than presence of a cilia- triggers ectosome biogenesis.  The cilia base of most neurons is embedded in supporting glial cells, and ectosomes formed at the cilia base are readily taken up by these glial cells. We show that glial phagocytic activity is involved in ectosome uptake by glia. However, these ectosomes are still produced in absence of glia, suggesting ectosomes are intrinsically produced by the ciliated neurons. Interestingly, disturbing glia phagocytosis by ced-10 mutations or by expression of a dominant negative Dynamin leads to abnormal shape of the ciliary base and defects in associated behaviours. We suggest that a neuron-glia coordination exists to remove from the cilia surface the ectosomes packed with receptors in order to maintain proper cilia function.",WBPaper00063397,Ectosome uptake by glia sculpts Caenorhabditis elegans sensory cilia,International Worm Meeting,2021,"Razzauti Sanfeliu, Adria|Laurent, Patrick"
"C. elegans has a highly developed chemosensory system that enables it to detect a wide variety of volatile (olfactory) and water-soluble (gustatory) cues associated with food, danger, or other animals. Much of its nervous system and more than 5% of its genes are devoted to the recognition of environmental chemicals. Chemosensory cues can elicit chemotaxis, rapid avoidance, changes in overall motility, and entry into and exit from the alternative dauer developmental stage. These behaviors are regulated primarily by the amphid chemosensory organs, which contain eleven pairs of chemosensory neurons. Each amphid sensory neuron expresses a specific set of candidate receptor genes and detects a characteristic set of attractants, repellents, or pheromones. About 500-1000 different G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are expressed in chemosensory neurons, and these may be supplemented by alternative sensory pathways as well. Downstream of the GPCRs, two signal transduction systems are prominent in chemosensation, one that uses cGMP as a second messenger to open cGMP-gated channels, and one that relies upon TRPV channels. These sensory pathways are modulated and fine-tuned by kinases and phosphatases. Chemosensory preferences can be modified by sensory adaptation, developmental history, and associative learning, allowing C. elegans to integrate context and experience into its behavior.",WBPaper00029015,Chemosensation in C. elegans.,WormBook,2006,Cornelia I.

"Cilia were present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) and were retained by most organisms spanning all extant eukaryotic lineages, including organisms in the Unikonta (Amoebozoa, fungi, choanoflagellates, and animals), Archaeplastida, Excavata, Chromalveolata, and Rhizaria. In certain animals, including humans, ciliary gene regulation is mediated by Regulatory Factor X (RFX) transcription factors (TFs). RFX TFs bind X-box promoter motifs and thereby positively regulate &gt;50 ciliary genes. Though RFX-mediated ciliary gene regulation has been studied in several bilaterian animals, little is known about the evolutionary conservation of ciliary gene regulation. Here, we explore the evolutionary relationships between RFX TFs and cilia. By sampling the genome sequences of &gt;120 eukaryotic organisms, we show that RFX TFs are exclusively found in unikont organisms (whether ciliated or not), but are completely absent from the genome sequences of all nonunikont organisms (again, whether ciliated or not). Sampling the promoter sequences of 12 highly conserved ciliary genes from 23 diverse unikont and nonunikont organisms further revealed that phylogenetic footprints of X-box promoter motif sequences are found exclusively in ciliary genes of certain animals. Thus, there is no correlation between cilia/ciliary genes and the presence or absence of RFX TFs and X-box promoter motifs in nonanimal unikont and in nonunikont organisms. These data suggest that RFX TFs originated early in the unikont lineage, distinctly after cilia evolved. The evolutionary model that best explains these observations indicates that the transcriptional rewiring of many ciliary genes by RFX TFs occurred early in the animal lineage.",WBPaper00037724,Regulatory Factor X (RFX)-mediated transcriptional rewiring of ciliary genes in animals.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,2010,Piasecki BP|Burghoorn J|Swoboda P
"Animals sense their chemical environment using multiple chemosensory neuron types, each of which exhibits characteristic response properties. The chemosensory neurons of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans provide an excellent system in which to explore the developmental mechanisms giving rise to this functional diversity. In this review, we discuss the principles underlying the patterning, generation, differentiation, and diversification of chemosensory neuron subtypes in C. elegans. Current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying each of these individual steps is derived from work in different model organisms. It is essential to describe the complete developmental pathways in each organism to determine whether functional diversification in chemosensory systems is achieved via conserved or novel mechanisms. Such a complete description may be possible in C. elegans",WBPaper00006397,The worm's sense of smell.

"Cilia are an important cellular differentiation of sensory neurons for receiving information from the environment. 60 of the 302 C. elegans neurons have ciliated endings. Mutations in a large number of genes have been identified that affect the structure of these sensory cilia. Of these, daf-19 mutations are unique in completely lacking all sensory cilia. Aside from the absence of sensory cilia, the neurons seem to be morphologically normal. We previously reported that daf-19 encodes an RFX-type transcription factor that is expressed in ciliated sensory neurons.We also showed that DAF-19 regulates via its target site in promoter regions, the x-box, a number of effector genes involved in sensory cilium formation. These effector genes are expressed in essentially all ciliated sensory neurons and, when mutated, cause morphological defects in sensory cilia (e.g. che-2, osm-1, osm-6). Our results strongly suggest that DAF-19 regulates the differentiation of sensory cilia by activating the transcription of a battery of genes whose products form the sensory cilium. Cilia and flagella are structurally very similar subcellular organelles. Work done on the unicellular, flagellated green alga Chlamydomonas lead to an estimate of around 300 different protein components required for structure and function of flagella. We expect a similar number for cilium structure and function. We aim to initiate the identification of all ciliary components by analyzing genes that have an appropriately spaced x-box promoter element: so called xbx genes, hypothesized to be regulated by daf-19. In a first search through the C. elegans genome sequence, using an algorithm designed to find promoter elements, we uncovered more than 200 candidate xbx genes, several of which had C. briggsae homologues that also had an appropriately positioned x-box promoter element. Initial expression analyses of a subgroup of these xbx genes showed that, indeed, some of them were specifically expressed in ciliated sensory neurons in a daf-19 dependent manner. In another approach, using oligo-nucleotide arrays representing nearly all genes of C. elegans (1), we compared the gene expression profile of wild type and daf-19 mutants. A small group of genes was reproducibly down-regulated in a daf-19 background, among them known cilium-structure genes and several xbx genes. In combination with previous data about sensory cilia, these approaches have the potential to reveal all the genes required for sensory cilium function and structure.

"Carbon dioxide is produced as a by-product of cellular respiration by all aerobic organisms and thus serves for many animals as an important indicator of food, mates, and predators. However, whether free-living terrestrial nematodes such as Caenorhabditis elegans respond to CO(2) was unclear. We have demonstrated that adult C. elegans display an acute avoidance response upon exposure to CO(2) that is characterized by the cessation of forward movement and the rapid initiation of backward movement. This response is mediated by a cGMP signaling pathway that includes the cGMP-gated heteromeric channel TAX-2/TAX-4. CO(2) avoidance is modulated by multiple signaling molecules, including the neuropeptide Y receptor NPR-1 and the calcineurin subunits TAX-6 and CNB-1. Nutritional status also modulates CO(2) responsiveness via the insulin and TGFbeta signaling pathways. CO(2) response is mediated by a neural circuit that includes the BAG neurons, a pair of sensory neurons of previously unknown function. TAX-2/TAX-4 function in the BAG neurons to mediate acute CO(2) avoidance. Our results demonstrate that C. elegans senses and responds to CO(2) using multiple signaling pathways and a neural network that includes the BAG neurons and that this response is modulated by the physiological state of the worm.",WBPaper00031936,Acute carbon dioxide avoidance in Caenorhabditis elegans.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,2008,Hallem EA|Sternberg PW
"Cilia and flagella are important organelles involved in diverse functions such as fluid and cell movement, sensory perception, and embryonic patterning. They are devoid of protein synthesis, thus their formation and maintenance requires the movement of protein complexes from the cytoplasm into the cilium and flagellum axoneme by intraflagellar transport (IFT), a conserved process common to ciliated or flagellated eukaryotic cells. Mutations in murine Polaris ( Tg737 ) result in cystic kidney disease and left-right axis patterning defects associated with aberrant cilia formation or maintenance. Tg737 is expressed in ciliated epithelial cells, and the encoded protein, Polaris, localizes to the base of cilia and within the cilium axoneme. Here we characterize osm-5, the C. elegans homologue of the murine cystic kidney disease gene Tg737. osm-5 is expressed in ciliated sensory neurons and its expression is regulated by DAF-19, an RFX-type transcription factor, that governs the expression of several other genes involved in cilia formation in the worm. OSM-5 protein is predicted to contain ten tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs), a motif involved in protein-protein interactions. Similar to murine Polaris, OSM-5 protein was found to concentrate at the cilium base and within the cilium axoneme by immunofluorescence and an OSM-5::GFP translational fusion. Furthermore, time-lapse imaging of OSM-5::GFP fusion protein shows fluorescent particle migration within the cilia. Analysis of three mutant osm-5 alleles indicates that osm-5 is required for cilia formation and that the TPRs are essential for proper function of the protein. Overall, our data support a conserved role for OSM-5 in ciliogenesis, most likely as a component of the IFT process.",WBPaper00018240,"osm-5, the C. elegans homologue of the murine cystic kidney disease gene Tg737, functions in a ciliogenic pathway",International C. elegans Meeting,2001,Courtney J Haycraft|Peter Swoboda|Patrick D Taulman|James H Thomas|Bradley K Yoder
"lov-1 and pkd-2 are the homologues of the human autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) genes PKD1 and PKD2. lov-1 and pkd-2 are required for male mating behavior and function as male sensory genes. These two genes are exclusively expressed in male specific neurons: four head CEMs, ray RnBs rarely (in R2B and R6B) and hook HOB from late L4 through adulthood. How lov-1 and pkd-2 are temporally and spatially regulated is largely unknown. egl-46 is required for pkd-2 expression in the HOB neuron, but not the CEMs or RnBs (Yu et al. 2003). daf-19 , an RFX transcription factor, is required for expression of several cilium structure genes (Swoboda et al. 2000) as well as pkd-2 (Yu et al. 2003). We are interested in understanding the mechanisms underlying lov-1 and pkd-2 transcriptional regulation, male sensory neuronal development, and male mating behavior. n4132 was obtained in a screen for ceh-30 suppressors (See 2004 East Coast Worm Meeting abstract 248 Varner et al. ) and found to prevent pkd-2 expression. Our further characterization shows that the n4132 mutant lacks expression of both lov-1 and pkd-2 but not cilia structure genes such as osm-5 and osm-6 . In contrast to daf-19 mutants, we propose that n4132 disrupts transcriptional regulation of certain male sensory genes but not general cilia structure genes.

"During development, signal-regulated transcription factors (TFs) act as basal repressors and upon signalling through morphogens or cell-to-cell signalling shift to activators, mediating precise and transient responses. Conversely, at the final steps of neuron specification, terminal selector TFs directly initiate and maintain neuron-type specific gene expression through enduring functions as activators. C. elegans contains 3 types of serotonin synthesising neurons that share the expression of the serotonin biosynthesis pathway genes but not of other effector genes. Here, we find an unconventional role for LAG-1, the signal-regulated TF mediator of the Notch pathway, as terminal selector for the ADF serotonergic chemosensory neuron, but not for other serotonergic neuron types. Regulatory regions of ADF effector genes contain functional LAG-1 binding sites that mediate activation but not basal repression. lag-1 mutants show broad defects in ADF effector genes activation, and LAG-1 is required to maintain ADF cell fate and functions throughout life. Unexpectedly, contrary to reported basal repression state for LAG-1 prior to Notch receptor activation, gene expression activation in the ADF neuron by LAG-1 does not require Notch signalling, demonstrating a default activator state for LAG-1 independent of Notch. We hypothesise that the enduring activity of terminal selectors on target genes required uncoupling LAG-1 activating role from receiving the transient Notch signalling.",WBPaper00061641,"The transcription factor LAG-1/CSL plays a Notch-independent role in controlling terminal differentiation, fate maintenance, and plasticity of serotonergic chemosensory neurons.",PLoS Biol,2021,Maicas M|Jimeno-Martin A|Millan-Trejo A|Alkema MJ|Flames N
"The transition zone (TZ) ciliary subcompartment is thought to control cilium composition and signalling by facilitating a protein diffusion barrier at the ciliary base. TZ defects cause ciliopathies such as Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS), nephronophthisis (NPHP) and Joubert syndrome (JBTS). However, the molecular composition and mechanisms underpinning TZ organization and barrier regulation are poorly understood. To uncover candidate TZ genes, we employed bioinformatics (coexpression and co-evolution) and identified TMEM107 as a TZ protein mutated in oral-facial-digital syndrome and JBTS patients. Mechanistic studies in Caenorhabditis elegans showed that TMEM-107 controls ciliary composition and functions redundantly with NPHP-4 to regulate cilium integrity, TZ docking and assembly of membrane to microtubule Y-link connectors. Furthermore, nematode TMEM-107 occupies an intermediate layer of the TZ-localized MKS module by organizing recruitment of the ciliopathy proteins MKS-1, TMEM-231 (JBTS20) and JBTS-14 (TMEM237). Finally, MKS module membrane proteins are immobile and super-resolution microscopy in worms and mammalian cells reveals periodic localizations within the TZ.

"Chromatin regulators contribute to the maintenance of the germline transcriptional program. In the absence of SET-2, the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> homolog of the SET1/COMPASS H3 Lys4 (H3K4) methyltransferase, animals show transgenerational loss of germline identity, leading to sterility. To identify transcriptional signatures associated with progressive loss of fertility, we performed expression profiling of <i>set-2</i> mutant germlines across generations. We identify a subset of genes whose misexpression is first observed in early generations, a step we refer to as priming; their misexpression then further progresses in late generations, as animals reach sterility. Analysis of misregulated genes shows that down-regulation of germline genes, expression of somatic transcriptional programs, and desilencing of the X-chromosome are concurrent events leading to loss of germline identity in both early and late generations. Upregulation of transcription factor LIN-15B, the C/EBP homolog CEBP-1, and TGF- pathway components strongly contribute to loss of fertility, and RNAi inactivation of <i>cebp-1</i> and TGF-/Smad signaling delays the onset of sterility, showing they individually contribute to maintenance of germ cell identity. Our approach therefore identifies genes and pathways whose misexpression actively contributes to the loss of germ cell fate.

"How signaling domains form is an important, yet largely unexplored question. Here, we show that ciliary proteins help establish two contiguous, yet distinct cyclic GMP (cGMP) signaling compartments in Caenorhabditis elegans thermosensory AFD neurons. One compartment, a bona fide cilium, is delineated by proteins associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), Meckel syndrome and nephronophthisis at its base, and requires NPHP-2 (known as inversin in mammals) to anchor a cGMP-gated ion channel within the proximal ciliary region. The other, a subcompartment with profuse microvilli and a different lipid environment, is separated from the dendrite by a cellular junction and requires BBS-8 and DAF-25 (known as Ankmy2 in mammals) for correct localization of guanylyl cyclases needed for thermosensation. Consistent with a requirement for a membrane diffusion barrier at the subcompartment base, we reveal the unexpected presence of ciliary transition zone proteins where no canonical transition zone ultrastructure exists. We propose that differential compartmentalization of signal transduction components by ciliary proteins is important for the functions of ciliated sensory neurons.",WBPaper00045913,Ciliopathy proteins establish a bipartite signaling compartment in a C. elegans thermosensory neuron.,J Cell Sci,2014,Nguyen PA|Liou W|Hall DH|Leroux MR

"We have mapped a protein interaction network of human homologs of proteins that modify longevity in invertebrate species. This network is derived from a proteome-scale human protein interaction Core Network generated through unbiased high-throughput yeast two-hybrid searches. The longevity network is composed of 175 human homologs of proteins known to confer increased longevity through loss of function in yeast, nematode, or fly, and 2,163 additional human proteins that interact with these homologs. Overall, the network consists of 3,271 binary interactions among 2,338 unique proteins. A comparison of the average node degree of the human longevity homologs with random sets of proteins in the Core Network indicates that human homologs of longevity proteins are highly connected hubs with a mean node degree of 18.8 partners. Shortest path length analysis shows that proteins in this network are significantly more connected than would be expected by chance. To examine the relationship of this network to human aging phenotypes, we compared the genes encoding longevity network proteins to genes known to be changed transcriptionally during aging in human muscle. In the case of both the longevity protein homologs and their interactors, we observed enrichments for differentially expressed genes in the network. To determine whether homologs of human longevity interacting proteins can modulate life span in invertebrates, homologs of 18 human FRAP1 interacting proteins showing significant changes in human aging muscle were tested for effects on nematode life span using RNAi. Of 18 genes tested, 33% extended life span when knocked-down in Caenorhabditis elegans. These observations indicate that a broad class of longevity genes identified in invertebrate models of aging have relevance to human aging. They also indicate that the longevity protein interaction network presented here is enriched for novel conserved longevity proteins.",WBPaper00033003,A human protein interaction network shows conservation of aging processes between human and invertebrate species.,PLoS Genet,2009,Bell R|Hubbard A|Chettier R|Chen D|Miller JP|Kapahi P|Tarnopolsky M|Sahasrabuhde S|Melov S|Hughes RE
"Cilia, either motile or non-motile (a.k.a primary or sensory), are complex evolutionarily conserved eukaryotic structures composed of hundreds of proteins required for their assembly, structure and function that are collectively known as the ciliome. Ciliome gene mutations underlie a group of pleiotropic genetic diseases known as ciliopathies. Proper cilium function requires the tight coregulation of ciliome gene transcription, which is only fragmentarily understood. RFX transcription factors (TF) have an evolutionarily conserved role in the direct activation of ciliome genes both in motile and non-motile cilia cell-types. In vertebrates, FoxJ1 and FoxN4 Forkhead (FKH) TFs work with RFX in the direct activation of ciliome genes, exclusively in motile cilia cell-types. No additional TFs have been described to act together with RFX in primary cilia cell-types in any organism. Here we describe FKH-8, a FKH TF, as a direct regulator of the sensory ciliome genes in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. FKH-8 is expressed in all ciliated neurons in C. <i>elegans</i>, binds the regulatory regions of ciliome genes, regulates ciliome gene expression, cilium morphology and a wide range of behaviours mediated by sensory ciliated neurons. FKH-8 and DAF-19 (<i>C. elegans</i> RFX) physically interact and synergistically regulate ciliome gene expression. <i>C. elegans</i> FKH-8 function can be replaced by mouse FOXJ1 and FOXN4 but not by other members of other mouse FKH subfamilies. In conclusion, RFX and FKH TF families act jointly as direct regulators of ciliome genes also in sensory ciliated cell types suggesting that this regulatory logic could be an ancient trait predating functional cilia sub-specialization.",WBPaper00065747,Forkhead transcription factor FKH-8 cooperates with RFX in the direct regulation of sensory cilia in <i>C. elegans</i>.,Elife,2023,Brocal-Ruiz R|Esteve-Serrano A|Mora-Martinez C|Franco-Rivadeneira ML|Swoboda P|Tena J|Vilar M|Flames N
"The molecular mechanisms of differential pattern formation along the left/right (L/R) axis in the nervous system are poorly understood. The nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans displays several examples of L/R asymmetry, including the directional asymmetry displayed by the two ASE taste receptor neurons, ASE left (ASEL) and ASE right (ASER). Although bilaterally symmetric in regard to all known morphological criteria, these two neurons display distinct chemosensory capacities that correlate with the L/R asymmetric expression of three putative sensory receptor genes, gcy-5, expressed only in ASER, and gcy-6 and gcy-7, expressed only in ASEL. In order to understand the genetic basis of L/R asymmetry establishment, we screened for mutants in which patterns of asymmetric gcy gene expression are disrupted, and we identified a cascade of several symmetrically and asymmetrically expressed transcription factors that are sequentially required to restrict gcy gene expression to either the left or right ASE cell. These factors include the zinc finger transcription factor che-1; the homeobox genes cog-1, ceh-36, and lim-6; and the transcriptional cofactors unc-37/Groucho and lin-49. Specific features of this regulatory hierarchy are sequentially acting repressive interactions and the finely balanced activity of antagonizing positive and negative regulatory factors. A key trigger for asymmetry is the L/R differential expression of the Nkx6-type COG-1 homeodomain protein. Our studies have thus identified transcriptional mediators of a putative L/R-asymmetric signaling event and suggest that vertebrate homologs of these proteins may have similar functions in regulating vertebrate brain asymmetries.",WBPaper00006052,A transcriptional regulatory cascade that controls left/right asymmetry in chemosensory neurons of C. elegans.,Genes Dev,2003,Chang S|Johnston RJ|Hobert O
"DAF-19, the only RFX transcription factor identified in C. elegans, is required for the development of neuronal sensory cilia.  Four isoforms of the DAF-19 protein have been reported, and the daf-19(m86) nonsense mutation affecting all four isoforms has been shown to inhibit cilia formation. Microarray analyses using RNA isolated from L1 or adult stage wild type and daf-19(m86) worms identified putative DAF-19 target genes regulated in these older animals.  The expression of transcriptional fusion constructs allowed us to compare expression patterns of several potential target genes in daf-19(m86) and wild type worms using confocal fluorescence microscopy.     We have shown that two new genes are activated by DAF-19 in both ciliated and non-ciliated sensory neurons.  Our data indicate that at least one new gene appears to be activated by DAF-19 in a ciliated polymodal neuron, IL1, which acts as a mechanosensory, motor, and interneuron. Conversely, we have found another gene for which DAF-19 represses expression in a non-ciliated polymodal neuron, I5.  I5 is a pharyngeal interneuron and posterior-sensory neuron. We are currently exploring whether the expression of these target genes is dependent upon the presence of a particular isoform of DAF-19.",WBPaper00047947,Repression and Activation of Target Gene Expression in Polymodal Neurons by the RFX Transcription Factor DAF-19.,International Worm Meeting,2015,"Olson, Haili|Phirke, Prasad|Swoboda, Peter|De Stasio, Elizabeth A."
"Amphid chemosensory neurons sense the external environment via their non-motile cilia, which are specialized for the particular neuron type. For example, AWB has characteristic forked cilia, while AWC has fan-like cilia. How are these structures specified and maintained? FKH-2, a forkhead domain transcription factor is expressed widely in the embryo (Molin et al., 2000) but expression is restricted to the AWB, ASK and ASI amphid neurons in larval stages and adults. In fkh-2 mutants, the ciliary structures of the AWB and AWC neurons but not other neuron types are affected. Dendritic development of AWB and AWC neurons is also affected in fkh-2 mutants, and this effect is manifested as stunting of the dendritic processes as early as the first larval stages. FKH-2 expression in the amphid neurons in early larval stages is regulated by DAF-19, an RFX-type transcription factor regulating general cilia development in all sensory neurons. However, the expression of fkh-2 is partly restored in daf-19 dauers and adults. It is possible that daf-19 could be regulating fkh-2 to determine cell-specific cilia morphology in AWB in addition to its general function in cilia formation. FKH-2 also acts in parallel with the OTX family homeodomain protein CEH-37 to specify the subtype identities of the AWB and ADF sensory neurons. Currently we are screening for additional mutants exhibiting altered cilia morphology specifically in the AWB neurons in order to characterize cell-specific factors necessary for their specialized cilia structure. We are also investigating the role of neuronal activity in the maintenance of ciliary structure. References: Molin L., Mounsey.

"Cilia and flagella are widespread eukaryotic subcellular components that are conserved from green algae to mammals. In different organisms they function in cell motility, movement of extracellular fluids and sensory reception. While the function and structural description of cilia and flagella are well established, there are many questions that remain unanswered. In particular, very little is known about the developmental mechanisms by which cilia are generated and shaped and how their components are assembled into functional machineries. To find genes involved in cilia development we used as a search tool a promoter motif, the X-box, which participates in the regulation of certain ciliary genes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. By using a genome search approach for X-box promoter motif-containing genes (xbx genes) we identified a list of about 750 xbx genes (candidates). This list comprises some already known ciliary genes as well as new genes, many of which we hypothesize to be important for cilium structure and function. We derived a C. elegans X-box consensus sequence by in vivo expression analysis. We found that xbx gene expression patterns were dependent on particular X-box nucleotide compositions and the distance from the respective gene start. We propose a model where DAF-19, the RFX-type transcription factor binding to the X-box, is responsible for the development of a ciliary module in C. elegans, which includes genes for cilium structure, transport machinery, receptors and other factors.",WBPaper00025051,Analysis of xbx genes in C. elegans.,Development,2005,Efimenko E|Bubb K|Mak HY|Holzman T|Leroux MR|Ruvkun G|Thomas JH|Swoboda P
"Cilia are widespread eukaryotic subcellular organelles that function in cell motility, movement of extracellular fluids and sensory reception. While structure and function of cilia are well known, there are many questions with regard to cilia formation and development. The RFX-transcription factor DAF-19 is crucial for the formation of cilia of sensory neurons. DAF-19 regulates the activity of its target genes by binding to the X-box promoter motif. We conducted a genome-wide search for X-boxes in promoters of C. elegans with subsequent expression and some mutant analyses of the group of positive matches in wild-type and daf-19 mutant backgrounds. Of the more than 30 transcriptional fusions tested so far in worms, we identified 18 X-box genes that function in the development of ciliated sensory neurons. We found that DAF-19 regulates not only genes for the cilium structure and transport machinery (che-2, che-13, osm-1, osm-5, osm-6, bbs-1, bbs-2, bbs-7, bbs-8, xbx-1) but also possible receptors (M04D8.6, T24A11.2) and other factors (odr-4, nhr-44). Most of them have homologous X-box sequences in promoters of C. briggsae, D. melanogaster and humans. We also observed that the actual X-box and it's position within the promoter can help us to predict expression patterns in ciliated neurons (in most or all / in some / in none). We propose a model where the gene daf-19 controls the expression of a ""ciliary module"" which leads to the formation of functional ciliated endings in sensory neurons in C. elegans. Different structural and functional parts of the ""ciliary module"" correspond to certain X-box compositions.",WBPaper00024803,"THE X-BOX REGULATORY MOTIF DRIVES THE EXPRESSION OF A ""CILIARY MODULE"" IN C.

"Cilia are sensory organelles protruding from cell surfaces. Release of Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) from cilia was previously observed in mammals, Chlamydomonas, and in male C. elegans. Using the EV marker TSP-6 (an ortholog of mammalian CD9) and other ciliary receptors, we show that EVs are formed from ciliated sensory neurons in C. elegans hermaphrodites. Release of EVs is observed from two ciliary locations: the cilia tip and/or Periciliary Membrane Compartment (PCMC). Outward budding of EVs from the cilia tip leads to their release into the environment. EVs budding from the PCMC are concomitantly phagocytosed by the associated glial cells. To maintain cilia composition, a tight regulation of cargo import and removal is achieved by the action of Intra-Flagellar Transport (IFT). Unbalanced IFT due to cargo overexpression or mutations in the IFT machinery leads to local accumulation of ciliary proteins. Disposal of excess ciliary proteins via EVs reduces their local accumulation and exports them to the environment and/or to the glia associated to these ciliated neurons. We suggest that EV budding from cilia subcompartments acts as a safeguard mechanism to remove deleterious excess of ciliary material.",WBPaper00061932,Ectocytosis prevents accumulation of ciliary cargo in C. elegans sensory neurons.,Elife,2021,Razzauti A|Laurent PF
"Cilia are cellular projections that perform sensory and motile functions. A key ciliary subdomain is the transition zone, which lies between basal body and axoneme. Previous work in Caenorhabditis elegans identified two ciliopathy-associated protein complexes or modules that direct assembly of transition zone Y-links. Here, we identify C. elegans CEP290 as a component of a third module required to form an inner scaffolding structure called the central cylinder. Co-inhibition of all three modules completely disrupted transition zone structure. Surprisingly, axoneme assembly was only mildly perturbed. However, dendrite extension by retrograde migration was strongly impaired, revealing an unexpected role for the transition zone in cell adhesion.",WBPaper00046970,The ciliary transition zone functions in cell adhesion but is dispensable for axoneme assembly in C. elegans.,J Cell Biol,2015,Schouteden C|Serwas D|Palfy M|Dammermann A
"Monitoring Editor: Keith Mostov Meckel-Gruber Syndrome (MKS), Nephronophthisis (NPHP), and Joubert Syndrome (JBTS) are a group of heterogeneous cystic kidney disorders with partially overlapping loci. Many of the proteins associated with these diseases interact and localize to cilia and/or basal bodies. One of these proteins is MKS1, which is disrupted in some MKS patients and contains a B9 motif of unknown function that is found in two other mammalian proteins, B9D2 and B9D1. Caenorhabditis elegans also has three B9 proteins: XBX-7 (MKS1), TZA-1 (B9D2), and TZA-2 (B9D1). Herein, we report that the C. elegans B9 proteins form a complex that localizes to the base of cilia. Mutations in the B9 genes do not overtly affect cilia formation unless they are in combination with a mutation in nph-1 or nph-4, the homologues of human genes (NPHP1 and NPHP4, respectively) that are mutated in some NPHP patients. Our data indicate that the B9 proteins function redundantly with the nephrocystins to regulate the formation and/or maintenance of cilia and dendrites in the amphid and phasmid ciliated sensory neurons. Together, these data suggest that the human homologues of the novel B9 genes B9D2 and B9D1 will be strong candidate loci for pathologies in human MKS, NPHP, and JBTS.",WBPaper00031596,Functional redundancy of the B9 proteins and nephrocystins in Caenorhabditis elegans ciliogenesis.,Mol Biol Cell,2008,Williams CL|Winkelbauer ME|Schafer JC|Michaud EJ|Yoder BK
"The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans responds to conditions of overcrowding and limited food by arresting development as a dauer larva. Genetic analysis of mutations that alter dauer larva formation (daf mutations) is presented along with an updated genetic pathway for dauer vs. nondauer development. Mutations in the daf-2 and daf-23 genes double adult life span, whereas mutations in four other dauer-constitutive genes positioned in a separate branch of this pathway (daf-1, daf-4, daf-7 and daf-8) do not. The increased life spans are suppressed completely by a daf-16 mutation and partially in a daf-2; daf-18 double mutant. A genetic pathway for determination of adult life span is presented based on the same strains and growth conditions used to characterize Daf phenotypes. Both dauer larva formation and adult life span are affected in daf-2; daf-12 double mutants in an allele-specific manner. Mutations in daf-12 do not extend adult life span, but certain combinations of daf-2 and daf-le mutant alleles nearly quadruple it. This synergistic effect, which does not equivalently extend the fertile period, is the largest genetic extension of life span yet observed in a metazoan.",WBPaper00002149,Genes that regulate both development and longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans.,Genetics,1995,Larsen PL|Albert PS|Riddle DL
Three types of microtubules are seen in the neuronal processes of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Single cytoplasmic microtubules of most neurones have 11 protofilaments whereas those of six touch receptor cells have 15 protofilaments. The axonemes of sensory cilia have nine outer doublets with a variable number (up to seven) of singlet microtubules. Mutations in 11 genes affect the appearance of these microtubules.,WBPaper00000937,Mutations affecting microtubule structure in Caenorhabditis elegans.,J Cell Sci Suppl,1986,Chalfie M|Dean E|Reilly E|Buck K
